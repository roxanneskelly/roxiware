</p><p>This post originally ran several months ago at the <em><a title="Girls With Pens: Marcy Kennedy and Lisa Hall-Wilson" href="http://girlswithpens.com/" target="_blank">Girls With Pens</a></em> blog.  It&#8217;s one of my favorites because I&#8217;m always looking for checklists to make sure I&#8217;m not missing anything while editing and revising.  I hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>Whether we plot our stories ahead of time or write by the seat of our pants, we need to ensure our scenes are working as hard as they could be.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we’re plotters, we consciously decide on the focus of our scenes ahead of time.</li>
<li>If we’re pantsers, we make up our scenes as we go along, and the conscious evaluation doesn’t happen until revision time.</li>
<li>And if we’re somewhere in the middle, we might have an idea of where the scene is supposed to end up, but we take a rambling path to get there, so our revisions will look more like pantsers.</li>
</ul>
<p>However we get there, at some point we’ll be taking a hard look at every scene.  Is this scene needed?  Is it too long or too short?  Does it have tension?  Does it avoid information dumps?  Etc., etc.</p>
<p>Great, but that’s all a little vague.  After all, <em>how</em> can we tell if a scene is needed?  Sure, some scenes might be obviously unnecessary as we pantsed our way down a rabbit trail, but other scenes <em>feel</em> like they’re needed.  So how can we tell?</p>
<h3>Guidelines for What Makes a Good Scene</h3>
<p>Good scenes should have at least three reasons for existing.  Those evil info dump or backstory scenes falter not only because of bad structure, but also because they fail to be relevant to the overall story.  They’re missing those other reasons for existing.</p>
<p>So as we go through our story, we need to make sure every scene has at least three of the following revelations:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plot point</li>
<li>a character’s goal</li>
<li>action to advance the plot</li>
<li>action to increase the tension</li>
<li>character development</li>
<li>a cause of character conflict</li>
<li>an effect of character conflict</li>
<li>how stakes are raised</li>
<li>a reinforcement of the stakes</li>
<li>character motivation</li>
<li>character backstory</li>
<li>world building</li>
<li>story theme</li>
<li>foreshadowing</li>
<li>the story’s tone or mood</li>
</ul>
<p>Janice Hardy has a great blog post about <a title="Janice Hardy's blog: Rule of Three: No, the Other One " href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2011/04/rule-of-three-no-other-one.html" target="_blank">how to mix and match these elements</a> in a way to make the scene feel like a full meal.  She points out that some elements, like foreshadowing, world building, or tone should be treated more like appetizers.  In other words, those elements shouldn’t be the main point of the scene.</p>
<h3>I Have Three Elements in This Scene, Am I Good Now?</h3>
<p>Making sure every scene has three reasons to exist proves the scene needs to be in our story, but we still haven’t checked to make it the best it could be.  When we’re consciously evaluating a scene—whether during initial planning or revisions—we need to be aware of the main reason that scene exists.</p>
<p>In her post, Janet talks about the elements that are legitimate main points for a scene: Is a character pursuing a goal?  Are we revealing important information?  Is the plot advancing?  Those questions ensure we’re not just padding an info dump scene with two other minor elements.</p>
<p>But even those questions don’t get to the heart of a matter.  A story is more than just a collection of plot points.  Stories are meant to evoke emotion.  So the most important question to ask ourselves is:</p>
<p align="center"><em>“What do we want this scene to accomplish from the reader’s perspective?”</em></p>
<p>Maybe we want the reader to be scared, or worried, or excited, or whatever.  Then we need to look at the actual plot points, dialogue, revelations, character emotions, and whatnot in the scene and decide:</p>
<p align="center"><em>“What’s the best way to show the elements of this scene to accomplish that?”</em></p>
<p>Once we know what we want to accomplish, maybe we’ll decide the words of the dialogue are revealing the right information, but the tone is wrong.  Or maybe we’ll decide there’s a better way to show the protagonist’s vulnerability.  Or maybe we’ll decide we let the protagonist advance the plot too easily.</p>
<p>This takes hard brainpower and conscious focus.  I’ll admit this deep evaluation doesn’t come easily to me.  But if I take the time to do it, I’ll often see how a sentence here or a reordering of paragraphs there will create stronger emotions in the reader.  And that’s what good storytelling is all about.</p>
<p>Are you able to evaluate your scenes in depth like this?  Does it come easily to you or not?  When you’ve evaluated your scenes, what have you discovered?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-pitch-writing/" title="Permanent link to The Ultimate Guide to Pitch Writing"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Spices-for-sale.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Array of spices for sale" /></a>
</p><p>As we head into &#8220;writing conference&#8221; season, I thought I&#8217;d revisit my post about how to write a pitch.  This post originally ran several months ago, but the information never gets old.  (In fact, I&#8217;ve used this to help myself write pitches lately.)</p>
<p>Pitches fall into many categories, from loglines and elevator pitches to queries and pitch sessions.  Essentially, they all perform the job of letting an agent or editor &#8220;speed date&#8221; through many submissions.</p>
<p>Pitches aren&#8217;t about selling a manuscript.  Their sole purpose is to get to the second date—a request.</p>
<h3>Basic Pitching Advice</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s first start with the basics.  These tips can apply to all of our writing, but they&#8217;re especially important when we have only a sentence or paragraph to make an impression.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be specific</span>: Details can make even the most formulaic story sound interesting.  Avoid cliches by being less vague.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be brief</span>: Whether we&#8217;re pitching a short story or a novel, we have to make every word count.  (&#8220;bully&#8221; vs. &#8220;mean kid&#8221;)</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be clear</span>: Our audience hasn&#8217;t read the story.  Convoluted sentences and subtext/allusion don&#8217;t work with speed-reading or listening.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be appropriate</span>: The tone of the pitch should match the story and genre (comedies should have amusing pitches, etc.).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be narrow</span>: Focus only on the main characters and the core conflict of the plot.  This tip goes double for any pitch shorter than two paragraphs.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be visual</span>: Instead of character names, create a picture with adjective noun combinations (tax-evading fireman, vegetarian vampire, etc.).</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be active</span>: Use active verbs to describe the plot conflict (&#8220;struggles&#8221; is better than &#8220;decides,&#8221; etc.).  Themes and character arcs aren&#8217;t a story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Core Elements of a Pitch</h3>
<p>Stories have characters, goals, motivations, and conflicts.  We see the same elements in pitches.  All pitches, no matter their format, give us an idea about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the protagonist (<em>character</em>),</li>
<li>the antagonist (person or situation to overcome) (<em>goal</em>),</li>
<li>what&#8217;s at stake (<em>motivation</em>),</li>
<li>and the obstacle (<em>conflict</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to making all that clear, pitches should also:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus on what changes (not what happens),</li>
<li>show the story world (genre, romance potential, etc.),</li>
<li>include a hook or unique element,</li>
<li>and show emotional appeal (the &#8220;why should we care&#8221; factor).</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy-peasy, right?  *smile*</p>
<h3>Methods for Writing a Pitch</h3>
<p>There is no &#8220;perfect&#8221; pitch, so rather than trying to come up with something brilliant (that I can&#8217;t duplicate with my own stories to save my life), I&#8217;ll touch on the various pitch-building methods out there.  Some stories might lend themselves to certain approaches more than others.</p>
<p>(Click on the links following some of the methods for more information about how to put a pitch together using that approach.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Stakes</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Complete this formula: An ADJECTIVE NOUN (protagonist) must ACTIVE VERB the ANTAGONIST before  BAD THING HAPPENS (which would prevent the protagonist from reaching his/her goal).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Goal</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Complete this formula: An ADJECTIVE NOUN (protagonist) wants GOAL WITH ACTIVE VERB because MOTIVATION (why the protagonist wants it), but he/she must first OBSTACLE/ANTAGONIST WITH ACTIVE VERB and STAKES WITH ACTIVE VERB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Conflict</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Complete this formula: When OPENING CONFLICT happens to CHARACTER(s), they have to overcome OBSTACLE to GOAL. (via <a title="Nathan Bransford's How to Write a One Sentence Pitch" href="http://blog.nathanbransford.com/2010/05/how-to-write-one-sentence-pitch.html" target="_blank">Nathan Bransford</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Obstacles</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify the protagonist and what they want and why.  Describe what keeps him/her from getting it.  Think along these lines: SOMEBODY wants SOMETHING and has a HARD TIME GETTING IT. (via <a title="Jane Friedman's The Basic Pitch Formula for Novelists" href="http://janefriedman.com/2011/07/30/pitch-formula/" target="_blank">Jane Friedman</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Twist</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify what&#8217;s unique about the protagonist and what connects that to the core conflict and the inciting incident or first turning point.  That plot point is where the story changes to put the protagonist in a bind and is often a &#8220;gotcha.&#8221; (via <a title="Janice Hardy's The Other Side of the Story: Here’s the Pitch—It’s a Hit! Crafting Your Novel's Pitch Line" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2011/10/heres-pitchits-hit-crafting-your-novels.html" target="_blank">Janice Hardy here</a> and <a title="Pickup Lines: The One-Line Summary" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2009/10/pickup-lines.html" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Choice</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify the protagonist, the choice he/she faces (conflict), and the consequences of that choice (stakes). (via <a title="Agent Janet Reid's Query Shark" href="http://queryshark.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Query Shark</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Inciting Incident</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify genre/setting, what makes protagonist unique, inciting incident, core conflict, and consequences of failure.  Unlike the <em>Focus on the Conflict</em> method, this approach often only hints at the goal. (via <a title="QueryTracker.net Blog: Writing Killer Loglines" href="http://querytracker.blogspot.com/2011/12/writing-killer-loglines.html" target="_blank">Stina Lindenblatt</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on a Question</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify the Character, Situation (why the protagonist has to act), Objective (goal), Opponent (antagonist), Disaster (obstacle).  Sentence one states the character, situation, and objective.  Sentence two is a yes/no question asking if character can overcome the opponent and disaster. (via <a title="Camy Tang's Story Sensei: The 50-word elevator pitch" href="http://storysensei.blogspot.com/2005/08/50-word-elevator-pitch.html" target="_blank">Camy Tang</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(Note that Camy mentions using the Black Moment for the Disaster, but many sources say to limit pitches to the first third or so of a story, so this might instead be the first turning point in the plot.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Emotions</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Brainstorm all the themes, events, climaxes, and words that describe the story, main characters, struggles, and emotions.  Pick the most important and compelling words or phrases and combine in the pitch. (via <a title="Help! I Need a Publisher: The 25-word hook revisited" href="http://helpineedapublisher.blogspot.com/2011/10/25-word-hook-revisited.html" target="_blank">Nicola Morgan</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Character</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Identify the protagonist&#8217;s flaw, the job or situation that forces him/her to deal with that flaw, the action he/she takes to overcome the flaw, and what he/she wants (and is prevented from getting because of the flaw).  Flaw + Situation + Action + Goal (via <a title="Cyndi Faria's One Sentence Hook – Adding and Creating Conflict" href="http://cyndifaria.wordpress.com/2011/10/01/one-sentence-hook-adding-and-creating-conflict/" target="_blank">Cyndi Faria</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus on the Theme</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Complete this formula: When a ADJECTIVE NOUN (protagonist) wants GOAL, he/she must learn THEME in order to FINAL OUTCOME.</p>
<h3>Now What Do We Do with This Pitch</h3>
<p>Many of those above formulas are geared toward one-sentence, logline-type pitches.  But once we have that sentence, we can expand it to create a longer pitch, like for a query letter.  Cyndi Faria has a great post about <a title="Cyndi Faria's blog: Turning a One Sentence Hook into a Five Sentence Paragraph" href="http://cyndifaria.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/turning-a-one-sentence-hook-into-a-five-sentence-paragraph/" target="_blank">how to turn a one-sentence hook into a five-sentence paragraph</a>.</p>
<p>Pitches aren&#8217;t just for those authors following the traditional publishing path.  Yes, short pitches have the obvious application at pitch sessions and long pitches are essentially query letters, but their usage goes far beyond that.</p>
<p>Short pitches can also be used to answer the &#8220;What&#8217;s your book about?&#8221; question we get from <em>everyone</em>.  They can introduce our story in sales copy (think bookmarks, advertisements, press releases, etc.).</p>
<p>Longer pitches can also be used for our online book descriptions at Amazon, or the back cover copy.  They can introduce our story in requests for book reviews or cover blurbs.</p>
<p>Many published authors say they&#8217;ve had to answer the &#8220;What&#8217;s your book about?&#8221; question from far more people <em>after</em> they were published than they ever sent out queries or did formal pitches <em>before</em> they were published.  Unless a story is shoved in a trunk, we will always  need a way to describe it to others.</p>
<p>What are some ways you&#8217;ve used pitches?  Have you started with a short pitch and expanded it?  Or do you develop short and long pitches separately?  Do you like using formulas?</p>

</p><p>Recent events have brought fan fiction out of the hidden realm of über-fans and into mainstream media.  For the first time, many authors are learning of the existence of fan fiction and wondering how it might affect them.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at what fan fiction is, what it means to authors, and what they can—or should—do about it in regards to their work.  Most importantly, we&#8217;ll talk about why authors should care.</p>
<h3>What Is Fan Fiction?</h3>
<p>Fan fiction (also known as fanfic) refers to stories written by fans about the characters, situations, or world of existing works created by others.  Some fans of movies, TV shows, and books want the story to live on in their head.  Maybe they relate strongly to a character.  Maybe they wanted the story to end a different way.  Or maybe they imagine the characters in a different situation.</p>
<p>In that regard, many authors feel honored by fanfic.  The fact that someone wrote fanfic for their work means that something about their story resonated strongly with readers.  Most authors consider that feeling of connection a good thing.</p>
<p>Websites such as <a title="Fanfiction.net" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank">fanfiction.net</a> exist for fans to share their stories.  The fanfic authors post their version of the characters and world, and readers can comment on the story, giving feedback or encouragement.  Most fanfic stories include a disclaimer stating that the characters and world belong to the original author and that no copyright infringement is intended.</p>
<p>Even so, some authors get uncomfortable when they think about those fanfic stories being shared with others.  Will someone else&#8217;s take on the story affect how readers feel about their characters?  Will readers get confused between the real version and the fanfic version of events?  What if a fanfic author&#8217;s version of the characters offends the original author?</p>
<h3>Is Fan Fiction Legal?</h3>
<p>According to <a title="Copyright Law of the United States" href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/circ92.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. copyright law</a>, the original author has exclusive rights to develop derivative works based on their stories, characters, or worlds.  And U.S. copyright law defines derivative works as “work based upon one or more preexisting works.”  That “based upon” phrase is pretty broad.</p>
<p>The <a title="What are Derivative Works Under Copyright Law?" href="http://www.legalzoom.com/intellectual-property-rights/copyrights/what-are-derivative-works-under" target="_blank">LegalZoom website</a> advises users that derivative work &#8220;is a new, original product that includes aspects of a preexisting, already copyrighted work.&#8221;  That &#8220;includes aspects of&#8221; phrase is similarly broad.</p>
<p>The <a title="Frequently Asked Questions (and Answers) about Fan Fiction" href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/fanfic/faq.cgi" target="_blank">Chilling Effects website</a> states that the prevailing rule seems to be that the more detailed a character, setting, or plot is, the more those elements are copyrightable separate from the original work.  Aspects that are &#8220;distinctly delineated&#8221; are protected even if the general copyright for the story as a whole doesn&#8217;t apply.  This means generic plots (boy meets girl) or characters (sidekick) are not copyrightable on their own, but that the <a title="Dear Author: Are Fictional Characters Copyrightable?" href="http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/are-fictional-characters-copyrightable/" target="_blank">main characters or specific plot details might have copyright protection</a> in addition to the overall copyright of the original work.</p>
<p>In general, the courts try to balance protecting copyright and allowing creative uses of copyrighted work.  The courts also take into consideration the marketing activities of the fanfic author.  If the fanfic is purely non-commercial, the courts are more lenient than if the fanfic author attempts to profit off their work.</p>
<p>In other words, legal challenges in regards to derivative works have limited precedents and aren&#8217;t black-and-white decisions.  And of course, copyright issues are entirely different in other countries.</p>
<h3>How Do Recent Developments Change the Fan Fiction Landscape?</h3>
<p>For most of fanfic history, everyone understood that fanfic authors shouldn’t make money off their work.  Not only is profiting off fanfic disrespectful to the original author, but it weakens the fanfic author&#8217;s defense in any copyright claims.</p>
<p>However, fanfic is currently in the news because the bestselling-series-slash-major-media-story <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> by E.L. James started as <em>Twilight</em> fanfic.  James took the characters of Stephenie Meyer’s <em>Twilight</em> books (and movies), swapped out Seattle for <em>Twilight</em>’s Forks setting, and gave the hero a BDSM background instead of <em>Twilight</em>’s vampire world-building.</p>
<p>The success of these books has many fanfic authors wondering if they should publish their fanfic works for profit as well.  The <em>Twilight</em> fanfic fandom is being torn apart by this issue, as many come down strongly on the side of <a title="When Does Fan Fiction Cross an Ethical Line?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/03/when-does-fan-fiction-cross-an-ethical-line/" target="_blank">&#8220;profiting from fanfic is unethical&#8221;</a> and others believe that the fanfic author deserves something for their work.</p>
<p>Many people wondered how Stephenie Meyer would react to the situation.  Would she take James to court?  This week, <a title="'Fifty Shades Of Grey': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml" target="_blank">she answered questions from MTV News</a> about the <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> books. Her response?  &#8221;I&#8217;ve heard about it &#8230; Good on her — she&#8217;s doing well. That&#8217;s great!&#8221;</p>
<p>Legally, that comment doesn&#8217;t mean she (or her publisher, or the movies&#8217; Summit Entertainment, or her estate after she dies) <em>won&#8217;t</em> take the issue to court somewhere down the line, but it looks less likely.  Her decision will likely further push the fanfic community toward an attitude of &#8220;profitability is okay.&#8221;</p>
<h3>What Does This Mean for Authors?</h3>
<p>In some respects, these changing attitudes are yet another indication of how the creative writing process is underappreciated.  We have book pirates claiming that all content wants to be free, readers complaining about ebook prices that are less than the cost of a movie ticket, and non-writers proclaiming that changing the name of a character or a few superficial traits makes them new and unique.</p>
<p>Authors should understand fanfic—its pros and cons—and decide how they want to approach the issue.  As an author gets more popular, the chances of having fanfic based on their work increases, but so does their clout, income, and motivation to enforce takedown requests.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the copyright issue, some authors worry about a fanfic author claiming they stole their idea.  With everything online, an author couldn&#8217;t prove they weren&#8217;t exposed to the fanfic story.  (A similar scenario happened to Marion Zimmer Bradley and one of her books was scuttled as a result of the fallout.)</p>
<p>What about concerns for how characters are portrayed?  Personally, I&#8217;m one of those authors who talks to her characters, in a &#8220;they&#8217;re just as real to me as my friends&#8221; way.  That sense of intimacy also means that hearing about some wild out-of-character exploits in a fanfic might damage the relationship I have with them.</p>
<h3>What Choices Do Authors Have?</h3>
<p>Many authors have &#8220;disallowed&#8221; fanfic, which in essence means that they request fanfic websites remove fanfics based on their work, and hope that people respect that request.  Authors Diana Gabaldon, Larry Niven, Anne Rice, J.R. Ward, and Orson Scott Card have spoken out against fan fiction.  A part of me doesn&#8217;t blame them.  After all, if the fanfic community doesn’t respect the original author’s rights, why would the author respect the fanfic community?</p>
<p>Other authors encourage fanfic in a &#8220;keep the readers happy&#8221; way.  Still <a title="Fan Fiction, Novels, Copyright, and Ethics" href="http://www.whoosh.org/issue62/ecks2.html" target="_blank">others allow fanfic but put restrictions on it</a>, requiring fanfic authors to fill out a form and request permission (authors such as Chelsea Quinn Yarbo, Mercedes Lackey, and Marion Zimmer Bradley fall into this category).</p>
<p>I respect what fanfic does and explores, but I don&#8217;t like the pull-to-publish movement (pulling stories off free fanfic websites to publish for profit).  It takes a lot more than just changing the name or other superficial details to erase the essence of the original author&#8217;s characters.  Unless the essence of the character (history, family background, worldview, religious beliefs, moral code, self-image, self-delusions, strengths, flaws, goals, etc.) was changed, <a title="What Makes a Character Unique?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/03/what-makes-a-character-unique/" target="_blank">the characters in a fanfic still belong to the original author</a>.</p>
<p>But with the iffy reliability of the court system to rule in favor of the original author, authors would be wise to try to prevent issues ahead of time.  Between the new profiteering attitude and the potential for counter copyright claims, I think authors should have an official fanfic policy in place.  Whether that policy is open or restrictive is up to the author, but a statement of our attitudes might hold off bigger issues.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m tempted to try to find a middle ground, where authors allow fanfic, perhaps under a policy that all stories labeled as fanfic of their books (and any money collected as a result of those stories) belong to the original author.  A policy like that would give fanfic authors freedom as long as they don’t try to make any money from it, and it would protect authors from someone claiming the author stole their ideas.</p>
<p>Along those lines, one author has suggested <a title="Creative Commons: The Answer to the Fanfic Question?" href="http://imeldaevans.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/creative-commons-the-answer-to-the-fanfic-question/" target="_blank">offering Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licenses on our work</a>, which would allow fanfic for non-commercial uses only.  Whether or not any of those policies would stand up in court is an entirely different matter, however.  *smile*</p>
<p>Do you have any questions about fanfic?  Do you think authors should have a fanfic policy?  What seems fair to you?  Do you have a policy?  What does/would your fanfic policy look like?  What concerns you most about fanfic?  What doesn&#8217;t concern you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/are-you-in-this-for-the-long-haul/" title="Permanent link to Are You in This for the Long Haul?"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Uphill-climb.jpg" width="225" height="300" alt="Man climbing up a hill" /></a>
</p><p>It’s tempting to put all our effort into a big debut or breakout book.  It’s natural to want our work to make a big splash and gain attention.  We might think that if we break out, we’ll have it made.</p>
<p>But there’s a dark side to that approach, especially if our eyes are only on our debut book.  If we don’t succeed in making our debut huge, we might think we&#8217;ve failed right when we should be thinking about how we&#8217;ve just started our publishing journey.  We might give up before giving ourselves a chance.</p>
<p>On the other end of that possibility, if we <em>do</em> succeed—if we <em>do</em> start at the top—we might always worry about how there’s only one place to go from there.  Down.</p>
<h3>Is a Big Debut <em>Really</em> a Good Thing?</h3>
<p>The chances of having a huge debut are very low.  The chances of that success continuing release after release are close to nil or worse.  I can&#8217;t think of any authors who hit it big with their first book and continued to reach those numbers with their later efforts.  I&#8217;m sure there are a handful out there, but joining that single-digit number club isn&#8217;t a realistic goal when there are so many factors in that situation we can&#8217;t control.</p>
<p>However, when we decide we&#8217;re in this for the long haul, we stop chasing the mega-success we can&#8217;t control.  And we start focusing on the things we <em>can</em> control: our writing quality and our consistency of output.</p>
<p>The number of authors who started off modestly and then grew their readership from one release to the next is a much larger club.  Most mega-authors we can think of fall into this category.  That goal of growing our success from the ground up <em>is</em> within our grasp.  If we improve our writing and continue releasing new books, we have the opportunity to gain new readers each time.</p>
<h3>What Does a Long-Haul Attitude Look Like?</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I saw a quote from filmmaker Woody Allen that really resonated with me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve managed to avoid over decades the hit-flop syndrome.  Most filmmakers work in that spectrum, and they have the pluses and minuses.  They get the delight and pleasure out of a great hit, and they love the awards, they love the parties, the premieres.  The box-office returns are heady for them, and they love it.  But when something doesn&#8217;t work, very often, they have trouble getting money for their next picture.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I&#8217;ve never had that problem.  I&#8217;ve never had their joys or their lows.  I&#8217;ve just sort of existed since 1968 making films kind of on a low flame, burning on a low flame.  And that&#8217;s fine, because the fun for me is to make the picture.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>That’s</em> the attitude I want to have for my career.  My focus is on writing the best stories I can—and that&#8217;s where I get my joy.</p>
<p>Woody Allen <em>has</em> had big successes.  But that was never his focus, never his goal.  He didn&#8217;t dwell on those successes because he was always looking toward the next story.  Similarly, he didn&#8217;t dwell on his failures, on the years where people said he was a has-been, because he had a job to do: make the next film.  We can do the same.</p>
<h3>What Does &#8220;Long Haul&#8221; Mean to You?</h3>
<p>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t mind a big debut or a big breakout book, but that’s not my goal.  My goal is to keep my head down, work hard, improve my skills, and gain readers over time.  I’m okay with being patient.</p>
<p>Some people have wondered why I’m not yet published.  Why I haven’t jumped on the self-publishing opportunity to get my work out there.  I’m sure my career choices will continue to create questions about why I decided a, b, or c about an agent, contract, or publisher.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.  We all have different goals.  We all envision different career paths for ourselves.  If I wanted a different path, yes, I could have been published by now.</p>
<p>But I’m not in this for the now, the immediate, the breakout.  I’m in this for the long haul.  And that attitude places me on a different path than some would assume. As long as I’m making progress along my path, I’m not frustrated.  This is also why I don’t get jealous of others’ success.  Their path is not my path.</p>
<h3>The Dangers of Short-Term Thinking</h3>
<p>We can apply this long-haul approach to not only to book publishing, but everything else as well.  Some obsess over their blog traffic numbers.  Or Twitter followers.  Or Facebook friends.</p>
<p>And some might <em>need</em> to focus on those things depending on their goals.  But too many worry about their social media numbers, sales numbers, or ranking numbers when it doesn&#8217;t really matter in the big picture of their goals.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, focusing on the wrong things can make us give up before we really start.  And that would be a shame.</p>
<p>I know writers who have stopped making time for their writing because they&#8217;re frustrated or discouraged or what-have-you.  Some of them are great writers, and I hate to see them prematurely give up.</p>
<p>Others have gotten impatient and published their work too soon.  I see their potential for greatness, but they never gave themselves permission to take the time to do things right.</p>
<p>Self-published or traditionally published, giving up or pushing too fast, patience plays a much bigger role in our long-term success than we think.  Woody Allen&#8217;s goal?  Make one movie a year on a modest budget and avoid the hype.</p>
<p>The key to being in this career for the long haul is having goals one year, three years, five years, and ten years out.  The key is having the patience to realize we won&#8217;t reach all our goals <em>this</em> year.  And the key is being okay with that.  *smile*</p>
<p>Are you in this for the long haul?  What does that mean to you?  How do you maintain that attitude?  If you&#8217;re focused on the short term, why have you chosen that approach?  How has it helped you?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/has-writing-made-your-life-strange/" title="Permanent link to Has Writing Made Your Life&#8230;Strange?"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Cadillac-in-wall.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Cadillac bursting out of a wall" /></a>
</p><p>We writers can be a strange lot.  We live in our heads, we talk to imaginary characters, we rejoice when we think of horrible things to do to said characters, and we plot out perfect crimes, alien invasions, and the end of the world.</p>
<p>But even beyond all that, writing affects our life in other ways.  Maybe we make a new best friend in our critique partner.  Maybe our neighbor thinks we&#8217;re awesome because we&#8217;re a writer.  Maybe we people-watch more closely for character ideas.</p>
<p>And then we have the ways that writing can make our life just plain strange.  Like when we stop a conversation in the middle of a sentence to jot down a story idea we just had.  When our Google search history would make a government agent flag us as a potential threat.  Or when we ask our significant other, &#8220;If you were going to kill someone, how would you do it?  Would murder by knife or by shotgun be less messy?&#8221;</p>
<p>I had two close encounters with weird this week.  Other families might talk about politics or play &#8220;I Spy&#8221; during a long drive.  Not mine.  (Heh.  I love my family.  They&#8217;re crazy like I am.)</p>
<p>There we are in the car and the conversation <em>somehow</em> lands on the subject of zombies.  I honestly can&#8217;t remember how—no really, I can&#8217;t—but we were talking about this T-shirt with zombies on a tractor yelling, &#8220;Graains.&#8221;  (Instead of &#8220;brains,&#8221; get it?  *smile*)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://shirt.woot.com/friends.aspx?k=26961" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-4958 aligncenter" title="Graains T-shirt off Woot" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Graains.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>We then spent the next 45 minutes of the drive coming up with other zombie sayings.  What&#8217;s a zombie construction worker&#8217;s favorite piece of equipment?  Craanes!  What does a zombie driver pay attention to?  Laanes!  What does a zombie plumber love to work on?  Draains!</p>
<p>By the end of the drive, we were laughing about how other families probably don&#8217;t have conversations like this.  But I&#8217;ve always followed the motto, &#8220;Why Be Normal?&#8221;  Luckily, I have the perfect family to indulge me.  *grin*</p>
<p>My second run-in with weird has more of a <em>Twilight Zone</em> vibe.  This past weekend, I was editing one of my stories and added two sentences to the very first paragraph.  I hadn&#8217;t changed this paragraph in almost six months, so it was a big deal to make this edit.</p>
<p>I added one sentence about a bent prong on a ring, and another sentence about a loose gemstone.  (Trust me, it makes sense in context.)  Less than <em>two days later</em> I discovered a broken prong on a ring and the stone missing.  Seriously.  (At least I did find the stone right away.)</p>
<p>This is a ring I wear constantly, and I&#8217;ve never had any problems with it.  (In fact, I&#8217;ve never had this issue before—with any ring.)  Yet, right after writing about a jewelry issue, I had <em>the same exact problem</em> in real life.  Is that strange or what?</p>
<p>Should I be careful of what I write in the future?  Or is that a sign I need to buy a lottery ticket?  Ooo, maybe I should write about a character <em>winning</em> the lottery.  Yes, that&#8217;s it!  Regardless of the chances of me winning the lottery, I thought it would be fun to compare stories of how writing has made our life cool, weird, and/or interesting.</p>
<p>Have you ever met a new person and they reminded you of one of your characters?  Have you reconnected with an old friend because of your writing?  Have you done something unusual for story research?  What&#8217;s the strangest, craziest, most intriguing thing to have happened to you because you&#8217;re a writer?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/youll-look-like-a-spammer-if/" title="Permanent link to You&#8217;ll Look Like a Spammer If&#8230;"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Spam-list.jpg" width="276" height="186" alt="Screen shot of spam subject lines" /></a>
</p><p>If you&#8217;ve had email for a while, you&#8217;re familiar with email spam.  Spammers often try to make their emails <em>seem</em> relevant, with fake warnings about our PayPal or eBay account, etc., but their messages have nothing to do with us (um, yeah, Viagra doesn&#8217;t apply to me).  We&#8217;re just an email address to them.</p>
<p>I wonder if this perspective of spam—messages from a random sender to a random receiver—explains why some people insist on using social media to spam others.  Do some people think, &#8220;Hey, they followed me back, so they <em>must</em> want to hear all about my latest book release/webinar/product&#8221;?</p>
<p>To anyone who thinks that way, here&#8217;s a clue: They don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A &#8220;friend&#8221; or &#8220;follow&#8221; doesn&#8217;t automatically flip the switch to change the sender from a random person to a connected person. So unless we&#8217;ve built up a relationship with someone through social media, by being, you know, <em>social</em>, unasked for messages <em>are</em> spam.</p>
<p>I see people who <em>should</em> know better do spammy things all the time.  I often give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to these &#8220;no-no&#8221;s, but others won&#8217;t.  So to help those social media users—who <em>are</em> real people, but simply haven&#8217;t figured out the &#8220;rules&#8221; yet—I offer this list.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;ll Look Like a Spammer If&#8230;</h2>
<h3>You&#8217;re Pushy with Links</h3>
<p>Every social media platform has types of messages that can trigger an email notification.  We should use those communication methods with caution.  There&#8217;s a big difference between posting something to the general update section and grabbing people by their collars and insisting they pay attention.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have good reasons for making sure people see a link.  If we mention them in a blog post or we know they&#8217;re interested in a subject, we <em>should</em> point out the link to them.  Otherwise, use the general update stream. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Twitter, don&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>Direct message <span style="text-decoration: underline;">new</span> followers with <em>any</em> type of link. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ever.</span></li>
<li>Direct message links to followers without a reason.</li>
<li>@ mention links to people without a reason.</li>
</ul>
<li>On Facebook, don&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>Message links to friends without a reason.</li>
</ul>
<li>On Google+, don&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>Share a post directly with people without a reason.</li>
</ul>
<li>On Goodreads, don&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>Message friends about every blog post or giveaway you have.  (If we were that interested, we&#8217;d sign up for your blog and/or newsletter.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I know those seem basic, but I get &#8220;so-and-so shared a post with you&#8221; notifications on Google+ at least once a week, and the posts have nothing to do with me or my interests.  There are several authors (one of whom claims to be a social media queen) who send out Goodreads events or links every week.  On Twitter, I&#8217;ve gotten DMs from people asking me to check out their random blog post and tweet about it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to turn off email notifications for those messaging options.  I <em>like</em> getting email notifications for things I&#8217;m interested in.  But people who abuse those communication methods make it harder for me to find the notifications for the things I want.</p>
<p>Before sending an update outside of or beyond the public stream, ask yourself if <em>you&#8217;d</em> want to get an email about a similar update.  If it&#8217;s not worth an email, leave it in the general stream.</p>
<h3>You&#8217;re Making It All about You</h3>
<p>Social media should be social.  That means making sure you&#8217;re having a conversation and not just acting like one person with a megaphone, shouting, &#8220;Look at me! Buy my book! Read my blog!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I follow someone or confirm a friend request, I check out their stream of updates.  If all I see is the same blog link or purchase link over and over, I have no reason to connect with them.</p>
<p>Similarly, I look for whether someone has conversations, especially on Twitter.  People whose streams are all links and no conversation (even if those links are for other people and not just themselves) won&#8217;t get my follow unless they retweet links for a subject I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p><a title="Elizabeth S. Craig on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/elizabethscraig" target="_blank">@elizabethscraig</a> and her writing links?  I&#8217;m all over that.  Someone else with their marketing-only links?  No—unless they also have conversations.</p>
<p>Going along with that issue, share <em>why</em> a link is interesting.  I don&#8217;t click links without details of what I&#8217;ll find there and why I might be interested.</p>
<h3>You Haven&#8217;t Created an Appropriate Profile</h3>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to follow or friend someone if we have no idea who they are.  The &#8220;bio&#8221; or &#8220;about&#8221; section of our social media profiles is there for a reason.  Don&#8217;t leave them blank and/or worthless (&#8220;A dude.&#8221;).</p>
<p>Also, think hard before setting social media accounts to private.  On some platforms, the basic profile/bio/about information can&#8217;t be seen if the account is private.  That means that I have to connect to you before I can tell if I want to connect to you.  That&#8217;s a problem.</p>
<p>Creating an appropriate profile also includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Twitter, don&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>Leave the default egg avatar.</li>
<li>Follow people you don&#8217;t know until you&#8217;ve started tweeting.  (People who have no tweets look like zombie accounts.)</li>
<li>Use an inappropriately sexy picture as your avatar unless you want everyone to assume that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re selling.</li>
</ul>
<li>On Goodreads, don&#8217;t&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>Request friendships until you&#8217;ve rated several books. (People who haven&#8217;t rated a single book—or have only rated their own with 5 stars—look like they&#8217;re not interested in sharing their thoughts about books, which misses the whole point of Goodreads.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>You Do Other Annoying Things Like&#8230;</h3>
<ul>
<li>You follow people and then unfollow them as soon as they follow back.  (We&#8217;re on to those who run up their follower numbers to make them look popular.)</li>
<li>You follow and unfollow and follow again repeatedly, hoping that we&#8217;ll eventually pay attention and follow you back.  (I keep every &#8220;so-and-so is now following you on Twitter&#8221; message, so I know who these people are.)</li>
<li>You send people requests for apps in Facebook—over and over again.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we know we&#8217;re a &#8220;real&#8221; person, we might assume that we can&#8217;t possibly be a spammer.  Spammers are those messages that are automated, or stealing email lists, or trying to get people to click on virus links.  Not us.</p>
<p>But whether a message is sent by email or social media, the difference between spam and not-spam is whether the sender is selective with their audience.  &#8221;Because I have the ability to contact you&#8221; is not a reason to think <em>everyone</em> wants to know the information.</p>
<p>Facebook friends lists are not a gathering of playmates for apps.  Be selective.  If you know one of your friends uses that app, sure, message them—not everyone you know.</p>
<p>Google+ followers or Goodreads friends lists are not a replacement for a newsletter.  Go ahead and send one mass-mailing every six months or so, and use it to announce some big news and remind people to sign up for your newsletter if they want to hear every update.</p>
<p>Mass mailings through social media are just as spammy as mass mailings through email, so we need to use them sparingly.  If we make our messages specific and relevant to a selected target audience narrowed down from just everyone who&#8217;s following us, they&#8217;ll be more interested in what we have to say.</p>
<p>We have to be careful with how we present ourselves.  It doesn&#8217;t matter how real we are; if we act like a spammer, people will think we&#8217;re a spammer.  And losing followers and friends over that misunderstanding defeats the purpose of being on social media.</p>
<p>Do you disagree with any of these tips? What else can make a real person look like a spammer?  Have you been guilty of any of these?  Which ones drive you the most crazy? Do you have any tips for other social media platforms that I didn&#8217;t cover here?</p>
<p><em>*** P.S. I had some people ask for a deadline extension for the Win-Win Giveaway because they wanted more time to get their Random Act Of Kindness (RAOK) together.  As my whole goal with the giveaway was to encourage acts of kindness for writers who have helped us, I&#8217;m happy to give people more time to be kind.  *smile*  <a title="Random Act of Kindness Blitz and a Giveaway!" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/random-act-of-kindness-blitz/" target="_blank">Leave a comment about your RAOK to inspire others</a> and be entered into the giveaway. ***</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/what-are-you-looking-for-in-an-agent/" title="Permanent link to What Are You Looking for in an Agent?"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Binoculars-in-the-grass.jpg" width="300" height="199" alt="Picture of unseen person wearing a safari hat and binoculars peeking through grass" /></a>
</p><p>*Shh*  Be very, very quiet.  We&#8217;re hunting agents.  (Sorry, with that picture, I couldn&#8217;t resist the Bugs Bunny reference. *smile*)</p>
<p>Many—if not most—writers want to find an agent at some point in their writing career.  Even in this age of self-publishing, writers still want agents to help them with foreign rights, career advice, access to tricky markets (libraries), etc.</p>
<p>So the question of &#8220;what to look for in an agent&#8221; hasn&#8217;t gone away.  However, what we&#8217;re looking for might have shifted a bit from a few years ago.</p>
<p>Because we all have different goals and needs, there&#8217;s no single end-all-be-all list of &#8220;what to look for&#8221; in an agent.  Sure, we all want an agent who&#8217;s a good match for us, but what a &#8220;good match&#8221; looks like will be different for each of us.</p>
<p>Some of us want an editorial agent, who will help us with our manuscript before submitting to publishers.  Some of us want a business-minded agent with strong knowledge of contracts and royalty statements.  Some of us want an agent with oodles of contacts among editors and publishers.</p>
<p>There are no right or wrong answers, but we <em>do</em> need to know what we&#8217;re looking for before starting our agent search.  Authors with years of experience tell us that having a bad agent (or the wrong agent for us) can be worse than no agent at all.  So while an agent might be great for our friend and we might be able to get a recommendation (the Holy Grail!), the agent might not be right for us.</p>
<p>The factors we might be looking for in an agent include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re comfortable with him/her; we can chat and be friends.</li>
<li>He/she is with a big, powerful agency.</li>
<li>He/she is with a small, boutique agency (smaller ponds can be nice).</li>
<li>He/she is a former editor or has a strong editorial background.</li>
<li>He/she handles foreign and subrights and/or has a rights specialist in house.</li>
<li>He/she specializes in our genre, with contacts at every publisher.</li>
<li>He/she has a wide variety of publisher contacts and handles many genres, including all those we&#8217;re writing or considering writing.</li>
<li>He/she has a strong knowledge of contracts and/or has a contract specialist in house.</li>
<li>He/she has a coach or career mentor attitude.</li>
<li>His/her communication policies match our expectations (email vs. phone, frequency, timeliness, etc.)</li>
<li>He/she provides the amount of hand-holding we want.</li>
<li>He/she has the amount of experience we want (new and enthusiastic vs. experienced and business-minded).</li>
<li>He/she has experience analyzing royalty statements for errors.</li>
<li>He/she knows (or has in-house specialists for) other industry-related contacts: publicists, cover artists, authors willing to blurb us, etc.</li>
<li>He/she is located in New York City.</li>
<li>He/she is a member of <a title="Association of Authors' Representatives" href="http://aaronline.org/" target="_blank">AAR</a>.</li>
<li>His/her agency has (or doesn&#8217;t have) an epublishing or assisted publishing option (some people like this, and some think it&#8217;s a conflict of interest).</li>

</ul>
<p>We can analyze that list, prioritize it, decide which things are important, which things are nice to have, and which things are deal-breakers.  Knowing what we&#8217;re looking for will help us narrow down our choices and will help us recognize when an agent is a bad match.</p>
<p>On the other end, there are <a title="SFWA: Agents" href="http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/agents/" target="_blank">things we </a><a title="SFWA: Agents" href="http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/agents/" target="_blank"><em>all</em> </a><a title="SFWA: Agents" href="http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/agents/" target="_blank">should </a><a title="SFWA: Agents" href="http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/agents/" target="_blank">avoid when we choose an agent</a>.  Certain behaviors are signs that an agent is a scammer or a disreputable/dishonest person, such as requiring a reading fee, taking an above average percentage, etc.  In addition, we need to check that the author-agent agreement <a title="Literaticat: On Agency Agreements" href="http://literaticat.blogspot.com/2011/04/on-agency-agreements.html" target="_blank">doesn&#8217;t include nasty clauses</a> like <a title="SFWA: Writer Beware: The Interminable Agency Clause" href="http://www.sfwa.org/2011/04/the-interminable-agency-clause/" target="_blank">interminable agency</a>, <a title="Kristin Nelson: Pub Rants: Where “In Perpetuity” Might Come Back…" href="http://pubrants.blogspot.com/2011/04/where-in-perpetuity-might-come-back.html" target="_blank">in perpetuity</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Our list of which things are important won&#8217;t look like anyone else&#8217;s list.  Only we can determine the publishing path we want to take and which type of partner will best be able to help us along that path.  Whether we&#8217;re planning on traditional publishing, self-publishing, or a combination of the two, the right agent can help us no matter what our goals are.</p>

</p><p>Did you see all the posts and tweets yesterday about the Random Acts of Kindness Blitz? (#RAOKBlitz on Twitter)  Two very generous authors, Angela Ackerman and Becca Puglisi, of <a title="The Bookshelf Muse blog" href="http://thebookshelfmuse.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Bookshelf Muse</a> blog wanted to kick off the release of their book, <em><a title="The Emotion Thesaurus on Goodreads" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13554235-the-emotion-thesaurus" target="_blank">The Emotion Thesaurus</a></em>, in a unique way.</p>
<p>Just like how <em>The Emotion Thesaurus</em> helps writers brainstorm fresh ways of showing emotion, they wanted to launch their book in a non-cliché way.  Boy, did they ever succeed.</p>
<p>Instead of making their release date about them (and I&#8217;m totally breaking the rules by even talking about them and their book like this, but *pshaw* I&#8217;ve never been a rule follower), they made the day about writers supporting each other and showing appreciation through random acts of kindness (RAOK).  As Angela said in her email to the original participants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Imagine if Twitter flowed with Random Acts of Kindness #Hashtags, and everyone in the industry forgot about Self Published vs Traditional, forgot about Amazon vs the Publishing Industry, and instead&#8230;just remembered what brings us together and makes our community GREAT.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you take a look at <a title="Random Acts Of Kindness BLITZ...For Writers!" href="http://thebookshelfmuse.blogspot.com/2012/05/random-acts-of-kindness-blitzfor.html" target="_blank">their release day post</a>, you can see how fabulous the turnout for this idea has been.  As of the time I&#8217;m writing this post, they have 147 participants.</p>
<p>I was blessed enough to receive not one, but <em>two</em> RAOKs yesterday.  <a title="Melinda Collins's blog" href="http://muserantrave.blogspot.com/2012/05/random-act-of-kindness-blitz.html" target="_blank">Melinda Collins</a> and her family were recently hit by the death of her mother-in-law, and yet she <em>still</em> wanted to reach out to others with multiple offers of critiques and beta readings.  And then <a title="Janice Hardy's blog" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2012/05/random-act-of-kindness-blitz.html" target="_blank">Janice Hardy</a>, one of my favorite bloggers (I&#8217;ve linked to various posts of hers approximately a bazillion times) and a true writing hero of  mine, singled me out, wrote kind things about me (that I can&#8217;t even think about without tearing up again), and offered me a critique as well.  Please visit both of their blogs and tell them how awesome they are.</p>
<h3>Is Kindness Contagious?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;d originally received the okay from Angela to post my RAOK a day late just because of my blog&#8217;s Tuesday/Thursday schedule, but then I started thinking about Angela and Becca&#8217;s real goal with RAOK.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a book launch with a nice gesture thrown on top.  As Angela wrote in the email to us almost a month ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Imagine if this RAOK Blitz event were only a spark, leading to something bigger, something greater. What if our collective Random Acts Of Kindness led to MORE Acts of Kindness? Is Kindness contagious? Let&#8217;s find out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out, indeed.  Thanks to Melinda and Janice and so many others in the writing community, I&#8217;m overflowing with kindness and generosity today.  No joke.  *hugs everyone*  So here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a second to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">think about writers you know</span>, like the critique partner who works with you to improve your manuscript.  The writing friend who listens, supports and keeps you strong when times are tough.  The author who generously offers council, advice, and inspiration when asked.  Each day, people interact with us, help, and make our day a bit brighter and full.  This is especially true in the Writing Community.</li>
<li>Send them an email, give them a shout out, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">show your appreciation</span> in another way.  Angela and Becca&#8217;s suggestions for RAOK Blitz include:</li>
<ul>
<li>A book or ebook;</li>
<li>An offer to beta read their next story;</li>
<li>A pledge to donate some used books to a school or library in their name;</li>
<li>An offer to give them feedback on a query or first page, first chapter, etc.;</li>
<li>Mail them a small gift card to buy a book;</li>
<li>Send a (free) Thank You ecard;</li>
<li>Email a thoughtful note, telling them how much you appreciate them;</li>
<li>Or anything else you can dream up!</li>
</ul>
<li>Go to <a title="Random Acts Of Kindness BLITZ...For Writers!" href="http://thebookshelfmuse.blogspot.com/2012/05/random-acts-of-kindness-blitzfor.html" target="_blank">The Bookshelf Muse&#8217;s RAOK post</a> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">add your name to the list of RAOK Blitz participants</span>.  While you&#8217;re there, pick up Angela and Becca&#8217;s <em>RAOK Gift to Writers</em> waiting for you.</li>
<li>Leave a comment on this post and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">share your RAOK Blitz story here</span>.  Let&#8217;s keep the kindness chain going.  Inspire others to reach out and do something for those in our community.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read on</span> for my part in all this.  *smile*</li>
</ol>
<h3>Kindness Rocks!</h3>
<p>My first act of kindness goes out to <strong><a title="Michele Shaw's blog" href="http://micheleshaw.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Michele Shaw</a></strong>.  Michele&#8217;s one of those genuinely nice people who we all wish we could have as a next-door neighbor.  She&#8217;s always there with support and understanding.  Poor Michele has been trying to move to a WordPress.org website for over a year—unsuccessfully.  So for my RAOK, I&#8217;m going to help her get her new website/blog set up.  If you have a minute, tell her how awesome she is (in fact, she&#8217;s so awesome, she&#8217;s doing her own Kindness Project at her blog!).</p>
<p>My second act of kindness goes out to all of you.  I&#8217;m like Angela and Becca.  I want to see RAOK continue to spread and grow.  The publishing industry is filled with bad news, lawsuits, arguments about the &#8220;best&#8221; path for publishing, etc., and I want us to put all that behind us, if only for a minute.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in #4 above, if you&#8217;ve participated in this RAOK Blitz, I want to hear about it.  To thank you for sharing your story here and encouraging others to pass a RAOK on, I&#8217;m doing a giveaway.</p>
<p>Leave your RAOK Blitz story in the comments by Midnight (Eastern Daylight Time) on Monday, May 21st, 2012.  I&#8217;ll select some random number of winners by some random method I haven&#8217;t figured out yet (this <em>is</em> RANDOM acts of kindness, right?), but more important are the prizes.  *smile*</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll be giving away at least one copy of <em><a title="Amazon buy link to The Emotion Thesaurus" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1475004958/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=jamgolparaut-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1475004958&amp;adid=0BJ6GWQGTQMWJ3A9VWXN&amp;" target="_blank">The Emotion Thesaurus</a></em>, an absolutely incredible resource for writers.  We&#8217;re always told to show instead of tell.  But how do we <em>show</em> emotion?  This book has the answers.  It&#8217;s a thesaurus of all those body language and visceral cues for emotional responses.  This book can be just what we need to improve our writing.</li>
<li>My <a title="@jaytechdad on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/jaytechdad">Tech Guy</a> will be giving away&#8230;  (Seriously, everyone, I can&#8217;t believe how awesome this is!) &#8230;at least one prize of a year&#8217;s worth of hosting for a website/blog, worth <em>over</em> <strong>$100</strong>!  You buy your domain name, and my Tech Guy will get you set up with a WordPress.org site (i.e. these aren&#8217;t the free WordPress.com sites that limit what you can do).  And he&#8217;ll also include your own email for your domain and <a title="Thesis theme" href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=198392&amp;u=438554&amp;m=24570&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=" target="_blank">the premium Thesis theme</a>, so you can do your own website design and customizing.  Amazing, right?</li>
<li>If you already own <em>The Emotion Thesaurus</em> and you already have your own non-Blogger/non-WordPress.com website, leave your RAOK Blitz story in the comments anyway.  The prizes are all about encouraging each other to keep this going.  I&#8217;ll figure out some way to show my thanks for your participation if you&#8217;re a winner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you been the recipient of a RAOK?  How did it affect you?  Have you participated in a RAOK before?  Do you think they help spread kindness?  Have you done something for this RAOK Blitz?  Tell me all about it!  If you&#8217;re a winner, which prize would you like (if you want <em>The Emotion Thesaurus</em>, would you want print or ebook)?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/are-ebooks-ever-done/" title="Permanent link to Are Ebooks Ever Done?"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Old-book.jpg" width="300" height="199" alt="Old book with latch" /></a>
</p><p>In the world of traditional publishing, if errors make it through the editing process for a book, authors (and their readers) are stuck.  A lucky few authors are able to get egregious mistakes like wrong character names or missing paragraphs fixed in later print runs, but most of time, errors remain in the text forever.</p>
<p>Enter ebooks and self-publishers.  Ebook (and Print-on-Demand (POD)) files are easier to fix and upload than the hard-formatted versions used in traditional printing.  And authors who self-publish can ensure fixes are made.</p>
<p>Is this ability to change an ebook file a good thing?</p>
<p>My first thought was &#8220;no.&#8221;  Too many times, if we think something is temporary, we won&#8217;t be as conscientious.  I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but my handwriting is neater when I know I can&#8217;t get a &#8220;re-do.&#8221;  *smile*</p>
<p>Similarly, I want authors to treat their ebook files as a permanent, final version.  I don&#8217;t mean authors shouldn&#8217;t fix a typo if they find it, but I want to trust they did their utmost to ensure a book is free from errors, especially for anything above and beyond minor issues.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been shocked to see some self-publishers take an &#8220;eh, I can fix it later&#8221; attitude.  I saw one self-publisher comment that he didn&#8217;t use beta readers because his real readers—the ones who have paid money for his book—would point out all his mistakes, and then he&#8217;d upload a new file.</p>
<p>Then what did he think would happen?  Most ebook retailers and self-publishers don&#8217;t have a nice, automatic way to update distributed ebook files, so readers are left out of later &#8220;fixes&#8221; for the most part.  That can make early buyers feel cheated if there are significant changes.</p>
<p>Granted, that self-publisher&#8217;s comments are probably an extreme case.  Just as likely among writers I know would be a perfectionist author, constantly wanting to tweak their books because they&#8217;re unable to let them go.  Neither approach is healthy in my mind.  Either way, I&#8217;ve always wanted to think of ebooks as being as permanent and unchanging as paper books.</p>
<p>Then I read an article yesterday that made me question my attitude.  The article was about an opera of all things, but it pointed out that <a title="Arizona Opera's malleable masterpiece of 'Orfeo'" href="http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/stage/articles/2012/04/03/20120403arizona-opera-orfeo-ed-euridice-phoenix.html" target="_blank">most art forms are malleable</a>.</p>
<p>Orchestras today have standards for what an A note is (440 cycles per second, apparently), but back when many classical songs were composed, there was no standard.  In fact, musicians often tuned their instruments &#8220;up&#8221; to sound more &#8220;brilliant.&#8221;  As a result, what we think of as an A note has changed over the centuries, and the classical songs we know don&#8217;t necessarily sound as they were intended.</p>
<p>The article then points out that da Vinci&#8217;s <em>Mona Lisa</em> has been trimmed down over the years and that there are three very different versions of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Hamlet</em>. How did we decide which one was the <em>real</em> masterpiece?</p>
<p>In other words, the article raised the question for me of whether art is ever &#8220;done&#8221; or &#8220;unchangeable.&#8221;  I know I prefer feeling like I have the final version of a book, but is that just my perfectionist nature speaking?  I don&#8217;t know.  But as more readers transition to e-reading, our always fluctuating culture might change its perspective on books in ways we never anticipated.</p>
<p>Do you think the ability to change ebook (or POD) files will affect how we view the permanency of books?  Should authors ever change ebook files?  Does your answer depend on if the change is for minor typos vs. more involved changes?  Do you think the ability to change files leads to a less conscientious attitude?  If an author changes an ebook file you&#8217;ve purchased, do you want to be notified of the update?</p>

</p><p>I love when I make my readers think.  Even better is when they turn around and make me think even deeper about an issue.  *smile*</p>
<p>Yesterday, K.J. Pugh blogged about my last post (where I talked about <a title="Cliffhangers: Not Just for the End of a Book" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/cliffhangers-not-just-for-the-end-of-a-book/" target="_blank">cliffhangers and hooks</a>) and <a title="K.J. Pugh's blog: Non-Action Scenes and Sequels – One and the Same?" href="http://kjpugh.wordpress.com/2012/05/07/non-action-scenes-and-sequels-one-and-the-same/" target="_blank">brought up the issue of sequels</a> I briefly mentioned.  No, we&#8217;re not talking about book sequels, but about scenes and sequels.</p>
<p>In that post, I linked to two articles by author Janice Hardy that explained more about scenes and sequels.  As <a title="Janice Hardy: Taking the Scenic Route: Scenes and Sequels" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2009/05/taking-scenic-route.html" target="_blank">Janice explains</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Basic scene structure goes something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Protag has a goal. They&#8217;ll act in way to achieve that goal throughout the scene. They&#8217;ll either get the goal, don&#8217;t get the goal, get the goal but there&#8217;s a catch, not get the goal and make things worse. Scene ends, because the goal has been resolved in some way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then the protag reacts. They&#8217;ll have an emotional reaction, think about what they just went through, and then try to figure out what to do next. This is the sequel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janice goes on to point out that sequels can be anywhere from a single line to several pages long.  But one other thing Janice mentioned in that article struck K.J. as interesting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Sequels have no goals to move the story forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>This idea of the protagonist <em>not</em> having a goal can throw us for a loop.  Doesn&#8217;t that go against so much other advice we&#8217;ve heard about ensuring our protagonist is proactive and not passive, making sure our story is moving forward, maintaining the tension, etc.?</p>
<h3>The Differences between Scenes and Sequels</h3>
<p>The idea of scenes and sequels came from Dwight Swain in his book, <em><a title="Amazon buy link for Dwight Swain's book" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0806111917/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=jamgolparaut-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0806111917&amp;adid=1XEJD31GBN7CKEFPDCW1&amp;" target="_blank">Techniques of the Selling Writer</a></em>.  The differentiation he makes between them is not the same as how we usually think of scenes.  In his book, he says:</p>
<p>Scenes are made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goal</span>: What the protagonist wants at the beginning of the scene.  This is where all that good proactive stuff for our characters come in.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conflict</span>: The obstacles standing in the way.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disaster</span>: What happens that prevents the protagonist from reaching their goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sequels are made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reaction</span>: How the character reacts to the Disaster.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dilemma</span>: The choice the character faces because of the Disaster.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decision</span>: What the character decides to do next.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is key: <em>What the character decides to do next.</em>  That is, the Decision becomes their new Goal for the next scene.</p>
<p>If we understand the point of sequels, it suddenly makes a lot more sense why many sequels are only going to be a sentence or two.  Sequels are where the character adapts to the previous action, revelation, problem, etc. and decides on a new goal.  In that regard, <em>every</em> scene has a sequel, even if it&#8217;s just the character deciding to try the same thing again.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Traditional&#8221; Scenes vs. &#8220;Scene and Sequel&#8221; Scenes</h3>
<p>We usually think of a scene as events that occur in a specific place and/or time.  When the story jumps ahead a day or switches to a different location, boom, we have a new scene.  That&#8217;s how screenplays think of them too.</p>
<p>But Dwight&#8217;s viewpoint defines a scene more narrowly.  This isn&#8217;t good or bad.  I&#8217;m just pointing it out so we&#8217;re all speaking the same language.  Dwight&#8217;s view of a scene centers around a character&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about this perspective is that a traditional scene can thus contain several of Dwight&#8217;s scenes.  Character tries A (Goal), but it makes things worse (Conflict/Disaster).  Crap (Sequel).  Character tries B (new Goal), etc.</p>
<p>Anyone who has studied Dwight Swain&#8217;s Motivation-Reaction Units (MRUs) might be able to see where I&#8217;m going next with this.  MRUs are this same idea on a smaller scale.  Something happens (Motivation for&#8230;) which causes something else (Reaction).</p>
<h3>Everything Comes Down to Cause and Effect</h3>
<p>At their essence, stories are one big cause and effect chain.  A leads to B, which leads to C, etc.</p>
<p>We can see this on the micro sentence level with MRUs:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A shot rang out. (A leads to&#8230;)  Susie jumped (B leads to&#8230;) and knocked the platter of filet mignon off the table. (C leads to&#8230;)  Rover scarfed up their dinner before it hit the floor.</p>
<p>We can also see this on the macro scene level with Dwight&#8217;s definitions of scenes and sequels:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Susie wants to impress the handsome stranger by cooking a big dinner for him. (Goal A leads to&#8230;)  But her good-for-nothing brother had downed the nice wine she&#8217;d picked up and gotten himself rip-roaring drunk.  So drunk that he decided to start target practice outside the dining room window after she kicked him out of the house. (Conflict B leads to&#8230;)  After dealing with his antics all day, she was jumpier than usual, and Rover had an excellent dinner. (Disaster C leads to&#8230;)  Crap. (Reaction D leads to&#8230;)  Well, she couldn&#8217;t let the handsome stranger starve. (Dilemma E leads to&#8230;)  Hopefully, she could convince him to forgive her for serving a delivery pizza instead. (Decision F/new Goal)</p>
<p>Does it really matter with any of the above whether we call it goals, reactions, decisions, etc.?  Not really.  Just like with the small scale view of MRUs, <em>everything</em> is a  motivation (cause) for what comes after it, and <em>everything</em> is a reaction (effect) to what came before it.</p>
<p>One giant cause-effect chain links events from the beginning to the end of a story.  What matters most from a reader-who&#8217;s-unable-to-stop-turning-pages-even-at-2-a.m. perspective is that it all flows.</p>
<h3>Why Sequels Cause Problems for Writers</h3>
<p>The problems with sequels—those sections where the protagonist is adapting from a failed goal to a new goal—often come down to an issue of flow, and how they don&#8217;t link well to what comes before or after:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes we have a too-long sequel during an inappropriate time.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Does the character have time to ponder and weigh pros and cons right then?  If not, then a long sequel is ignoring the effects of the Disaster that came before it and how the character needs to decide <em>now</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes a sequel wanders or doesn&#8217;t seem to have a point.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Does the character reach a Decision, a new Goal?  If not, then the sequel is breaking the chain of cause and effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes a sequel loses the tension in a story.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Does the character worry about the consequences of the Disaster?  If not, then the sequel isn&#8217;t linking to past and future story events by making sure readers are up to speed on the stakes, the consequences of failure, and potential future issues (foreshadowing).</p>
<h3>Tips for Making Sequels Work</h3>
<p>So let me share a few tips on making the most of sequels:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you&#8217;re writing, don&#8217;t worry about if a section is a scene or sequel.  Think cause and effect, sentence-by-sentence, action to reaction, scene to scene, and you&#8217;ll never go wrong.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about sequels being passive unless the flow isn&#8217;t working.  The protagonist <em>does</em> have a goal in a sequel: <em>Come up with a new plan</em>.  *grin*</li>
<li>Just as with every other aspect of our writing, write tight.  The sequel should be only as long as needed for the character to explore the consequences of the Disaster and reach a new Goal.  That exploration can include all <a title="Janice Hardy: Quiet Time: Handling the Non-Action Scenes" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2011/03/quiet-time-handling-non-action-scenes.html" target="_blank">those foreshadowing, mood-enhancing, character development nuggets</a>, however.</li>
<li>Make the sequel feel &#8220;immediate&#8221; by weaving in external actions.  Remember <a title="Can We Have Too Much Voice?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/02/can-we-have-too-much-voice/" target="_blank">the two-paragraph guideline</a>? (I blogged about the <a title="Ask Jami: Editing Tips–How to Use Color-Coding" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/02/ask-jami-editing-tips-how-to-use-color-coding/" target="_blank">how</a> and the <a title="Ask Jami: Editing Tips–Tightening Scenes" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/03/ask-jami-editing-tips-tightening/" target="_blank">what</a> of the guideline as well.)  Avoid sequels with several paragraphs all in the character&#8217;s head.  If the story has time for a long sequel, then it has time for the character to do <em>something</em> while they&#8217;re thinking and debating.</li>
<li>For those few instances of standalone sequels (these still follow a scene, but are separated in time and/or space, and thus have a blank line before them), <a title="Cliffhangers: Not Just for the End of a Book" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/05/cliffhangers-not-just-for-the-end-of-a-book/" target="_blank">use cliffhangers/hooks the same way</a> we would at the end of any other scene.  The nature of a sequel (internal thoughts and decisions) often leads to an Emotional Journey hook, but other types might fit as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>To answer the question in this post&#8217;s title, yes, I think every scene (and sequel) needs a goal—in that the characters always need to be progressing toward something.  Stories are about change.  And if a scene (or sequel) is static, that&#8217;s when the pacing feels slow and the story seems dead.</p>
<p>However, as a pointed out in number 2 above, sometimes that forward progress might be as simple as a character knowing they need to come up with a new plan.  They&#8217;re still striving toward something even as they&#8217;re reacting to what came before.  And that struggle is what creates tension, keeps the story moving, and makes readers interested.</p>
<p>Have you studied Dwight&#8217;s scene and sequel or MRU concepts before?  Do you agree they&#8217;re the same cause-and-effect idea on different scales?  Do you think in terms of scene and sequel or in terms of cause and effect or something else?  Do you struggle with sequels?  Do you have any other tips to share on how to make sequels work?</p>

</p><p>Pitches, queries, back cover copy, and full-length stories all have writing techniques in common.  For one thing, they all need a strong opening. We talk about that being a &#8220;hook,&#8221; <a title="Pitch Prep: What Makes a Great First Page?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/01/pitch-prep-what-makes-a-great-first-page/" target="_blank">something that grabs the reader</a> and pulls them forward to the next line, paragraph, and page.</p>
<p>A similar approach works within our stories too.  We might employ hook lines to create a &#8220;dun dun dun&#8221; feeling during a scene.  At the end of scenes and chapters, we often want to use a line similar to a hook to ensure the reader doesn&#8217;t use that scene or chapter break as an excuse to put down the book.</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s beta read for me can attest that I use these cliffhanger-type lines at the end of many scenes and chapters.  I enjoy being mean to my characters and that often translates into making the reader want to continue reading to see what happens next.  *smile*</p>
<p>One of the workshops I attended at the Desert Dreams conference this past weekend was called <em>Hooks and How to Use Them: From First to Last Word!</em> by <a title="Terri Brisbin's website" href="http://www.terribrisbin.com/" target="_blank">Terri Brisbin</a>.  She pointed out that hook lines at the end of scenes or chapters fulfill the same purpose as those at the beginning of a story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;[It] leaves the reader wanting more—more information, more emotion, more of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, just like in real life, being in constant crisis mode can be draining.  Readers need a bit of breathing room too.  The incomparable author/blogger Janice Hardy is full of good advice about how to <a title="Janice Hardy's blog: Taking the Scenic Route: Scenes and Sequels" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2009/05/taking-scenic-route.html" target="_blank">use sequels</a> to <a title="Janice Hardy's blog: Quiet Time: Handling the Non-Action Scenes" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2011/03/quiet-time-handling-non-action-scenes.html" target="_blank">provide a quiet moment between big scenes</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have to be careful not to release the tension too much.  Terri&#8217;s workshop gave me some insight into how the lower-crisis moments of sequels, whether they&#8217;re a single line or a scene long, can still pack the punch of a hook to pull a reader forward.</p>
<p>Terri shared four main types of hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Physical Journey</span>: An action that propels the reader along the external plot.<br />
<em>Just then, a body tumbled down the stairs and stopped at her feet.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Emotional Journey</span>: An emotional statement that propels the reader along the internal plot.<br />
<em>At his declaration, the wall around her heart crumbled a little more.  Not again.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reveal a Secret</span>: A revelation that gets the reader&#8217;s mind turning with the consequences and new story possibilities.<br />
<em>&#8220;Luke &#8230; I am your father.&#8221;</em>  (*ahem* Sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduce a Mystery</span>: A revelation that creates more questions than it answers.<br />
<em>Caller ID displayed Rick&#8217;s number.  But if Rick was on the other end of the phone, who was singing in the shower in the next room?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These hooks all maintain the tension in a story, but some cause a more immediate sense of crisis than others.  By mixing up these types of hook lines at the end of our scenes and chapters, we can prevent the pacing and tension from being too &#8220;one note.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Emotional Journey&#8221; approach works well with lower-crisis sequels while still maintaining tension by hinting at future issues or foreshadowing problems yet to come.  Some &#8220;Introduce a Mystery&#8221; and &#8220;Reveal a Secret&#8221; lines need to be dealt with right away, and some play into overall story questions that add tension without requiring an immediate response.</p>
<p>If we use enough of these hook lines, we don&#8217;t need to plan chapter breaks in advance.  Every 8-20 pages, I simply pick one of the good cliffhanger lines and insert a chapter break.  By rotating through the types of hooks, we ensure our chapter breaks don&#8217;t give readers an excuse to put our book down.</p>
<p>These same types of hook lines work for the end of our query letter, pitch, or back cover copy.  Again, the purpose of &#8220;leaving the reader wanting more&#8221; is the same.  A reader who wants more after reading our paragraph or two will want to read the first page, where we&#8217;ll hook them into reading the scene, the chapter, and then the whole book.</p>
<p>Hooks kidnap readers and force them to experience our story, from beginning to end.  And if we do our job, they&#8217;ll be hooked by our writing and will be eagerly awaiting our next book.</p>
<p>Do you end your scenes and chapters on hooks or cliffhangers?  Do you mix and match the types of hooks you use?  What hooks entice you the most?  Do you plan chapter breaks in advance or use the &#8220;pick a hook&#8221; method?</p>

</p><p>As I write this post (late) Monday night, I just returned home after the regional writing conference, <a title="Desert Dreams Writers' Conference" href="http://www.desertroserwa.org/conferences/Phoenix-Romance-Writers-Conferences.php" target="_blank">Desert Dreams</a>.  I had a great time, met wonderful people, attended thought-provoking workshops, and pitched for the first time (and the second time and the third time).</p>
<p>I think the pitches went well.  I got requests and I didn&#8217;t throw up on anyone.  *smile*  In fact, I wasn&#8217;t nervous in the slightest.</p>
<p>Let me put this into perspective.  Last Thursday before the conference, I was a nervous wreck.  Hyperventilating, shivering, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.  I didn&#8217;t get <em>any</em> sleep Thursday night.  None.  Zero.  Nada.  Not even dozing off for 5 minutes in the middle of the night.  (Great way to start a conference, right?)</p>
<p>Luckily, my family was there for me.  Their support kept me from thinking about backing out.  They even drove me to the conference to make sure I arrived.</p>
<p>And from the time I stepped out of the car at the entrance to the hotel/conference center, I was fine.  No nerves or anything.</p>
<p>I was rather shocked at that extreme change.  How could I go from &#8220;ready to throw up&#8221; nerves to being calm and confident that quickly?</p>
<p>As the conference was winding down, I shared this story with two new friends.  One of them, Rose Meyer (and Rose, I apologize if I spelled your name wrong. I can&#8217;t find your card, did I get one? I&#8217;m so brain dead right now I barely know my name.  <em>Anyway</em>&#8230;) said:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;You&#8217;d left the plane.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was referring to the stories the other woman, Melissa Borg, and I had shared about skydiving.  We&#8217;d talked about how once you leave the plane, there&#8217;s no going back.  After that step, there&#8217;s no point in being nervous.  Gravity ensures that you&#8217;re just along for the ride.</p>
<p>The conference was a similar situation.  Once I&#8217;d left my ride behind, I was stuck there, so I may as well go with the flow.</p>
<p>This was definitely a time when the anticipation was worse than the reality.  I think that reaction happens to many of us.  We build up stress and worry, and then we wonder why we suffered through all that when everything goes well.</p>
<p>Some of us might freak out at the thought of sharing our work with beta readers for the first time.  Or sending a query letter to an agent.  Or submitting a final draft to an editor.  Etc., etc.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this is something that gets better with time and experience.  I hope so anyway.  I have <a title="What Makes You Feel Legitimate?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/02/what-makes-you-feel-legitimate/" target="_blank">my workshop</a> with <a title="Rachel Graves's blog" href="http://rachelgraves.com/" target="_blank">Rachel Graves</a> to look forward to at RWA Nationals this July, and I hate to think of how worked up I&#8217;ll be before <em>that</em>.  RWA Nationals is ten times as big as this regional conference was, and presenting to a roomful of people is different than pitching to a single person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pointing out to myself that I no longer stress about sending query letters (I still don&#8217;t like writing the darn things, but that&#8217;s a separate matter) or sharing my work with beta readers.  I hope other new experiences will soon become &#8220;old hat&#8221; as well.</p>
<p>All I know is that when we&#8217;re first doing something new, that &#8220;first step&#8221; takes a lot of courage.  We&#8217;re risking something different from what we&#8217;ve ever risked before.  We might have to psych ourselves up with not only &#8220;I&#8217;ll be fine&#8221; thoughts, but also &#8220;this step will be worth it&#8221; cheers.</p>
<p>For me, this step of pitching for the first time was worth it.  We can&#8217;t move forward and progress without risk.  Yes, that first step can be a doozy, but we&#8217;ll often find that the rest of the problem isn&#8217;t as hard as we&#8217;d anticipated.</p>
<p>Do you struggle with &#8220;first steps&#8221;?  Which ones have you fought to get past?  How did you do it?  Have you found it to get easier with time?  If you&#8217;ve done an in-person pitch, what was your experience?</p>

</p><p>I’m excited to share today’s guest post by author Roz Morris.  After ghostwriting many bestselling books, Roz recently self-published <a title="Amazon link to My Memories of a Future Life in print" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1463784902/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=jamgolparaut-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1463784902&amp;adid=0TA8Z2BV20RKEVFS2FDZ&amp;" target="_blank"><em>My Memories of a Future Life</em></a>, her first novel under her own name.</p>
<p>Roz&#8217;s decision to self-publish came about partly because this novel doesn&#8217;t fit into normal genre boxes.  However, even as a self-published author, she still had to write the back cover copy.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right.  Whether we query agents for traditional publishing or self-publish, we have to know how to summarize our book. I&#8217;ve mentioned many times that <a title="What Writing Skill Do You Suck At?" href="http://jamigold.com/2011/12/what-do-you-suck-at/" target="_blank">I suck at queries</a> and pitching and all things related to this &#8220;boiling down the essence&#8221; process, so I asked Roz to walk us through her tips for how to write back cover copy for even the trickiest books.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<h2>How to Write Back Cover Copy—No Matter How Difficult Our Book Is to Describe</h2>
<p>Back cover copy. A brace of paragraphs—sometimes called the blurb—to woo potential readers. If you&#8217;re being published traditionally, you can kick back and be grateful you don&#8217;t have to write it. But if you&#8217;re self-publishing, welcome to a world of woe.</p>
<p>Some writers have the knack of summarizing their own work. Most of us don&#8217;t, though, and are further paralyzed because they&#8217;ve spent months eye to eye with every syllable. The ethersphere regularly resounds to the cries of blurbing tweeps and bloggers, chirping, where do I start? What do I leave out?</p>
<h3>Tips for Writing Back Cover Copy for Genre Books</h3>
<p>I had a right old nightmare writing mine, so here are my tips for getting it done.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.  Immerse yourself in other blurbs</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Blurbs have their own language. Go on Amazon, Goodreads or your preferred emporium. Collect blurbs for novels that are like yours and soak up the way they sum up a novel in a brief sweep. Usually they mention the main character, what they want and what&#8217;s stopping them. Scroll down to reader reviews too, because sometimes these summarize as well, giving you another run at the same story.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.  Hit your genre&#8217;s marks</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Genres are about reader expectations. Your blurb must reassure the reader the book has the tropes they like—so notice how these are deployed in the blurbs you read. For steampunk, historical, fantasy, the setting is part of the sizzle. For action thrillers it might be the gritty ex-forces hero. For crime procedural it&#8217;s the puzzle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.  Use feedback from your editor and beta readers</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You&#8217;ve probably been working with an editor. They won&#8217;t usually write your blurb, but their reports and emails are a useful outsider&#8217;s view of your book. Same with beta readers. Check back over correspondence to see if something they&#8217;ve said should go into your blurb. In particular, look at what makes your book fit in with the genre—and how it stands out.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re thinking in blurb language, have a stab at your own. You&#8217;ll probably need several goes, so after each draft read another batch of back covers like yours and refine. Bounce them off your beta readers if they&#8217;re willing.</p>
<p>Just because the blurb is short doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s easy to write. It may well take a bit of to and fro—and anguished tweeting—to keep yourself sane. That paragraph has got a lot of heavy lifting to do.</p>
<h3>The Difficulties of Summarizing Non-Genre Books</h3>
<p>BUT&#8230; what if you&#8217;ve got a non-genre or difficult novel?</p>
<p>If genre is about expectations, in non-genre, anything goes. This causes you problems all over the place, from writing the book to selling it. And of course when writing cover copy.</p>
<p>I got myself in exquisite knots trying to blurb <em>My Memories of a Future Life</em>. It&#8217;s a hybrid of literary fiction with a splash of magic realism. Maybe. The other day someone argued for why it was contemporary women&#8217;s fiction. Whatever— writing it was tricky enough; blurbing it was murder.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Write Back Cover Copy: Part One</h3>
<p>Guided by sample blurbs, my first approach was to start with the opening events.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carol is a musician who may lose her career because of an injury. Her flatmate is miraculously cured of panic attacks when he is regressed to Victorian England and finds he was killed by Jack the Ripper. Carol gets drawn into a hypnotic journey to another life of her own.&#8221; etc etc  When I read it to friends, they looked like they&#8217;d sat on live electrodes. Result!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they made the wrong connection. These events are important, but Jack the Ripper is a minor appearance and there&#8217;s hardly any other Victoriana. Although it pushed their buttons, it pushed the wrong ones.</p>
<p>Lesson: Every word in a blurb sets up expectations. Use them with care.</p>
<p>My next approach was to describe the first scene, into which I had condensed the themes and the character’s problem in oblique style. &#8220;It opens with a scene of yoga rage,&#8221; I said to another group of (tolerant) friends. Again, they zapped to attention. Again, for the wrong reasons. The yoga scene was what I used to introduce the character—a situation of enforced stillness she is hating—but it was a detail and misleading when given such prominence. When they heard it in isolation, they were expecting chick-lit. It shortchanged the book as a whole.</p>
<p>Lesson: When blurbing, it&#8217;s easy to think of a great soundbite and then become attached to it. Yoga rage is right for the scene, but gives the wrong idea about the book. Just as we have to kill our darlings in the main text, we have to kill our darlings in the blurb too.</p>
<p>Blurbs also need to give a flavor of the book&#8217;s mood, and &#8216;yoga rage&#8217; is totally at odds with that. The story is actually yearning and melancholy.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Write Back Cover Copy: Part Two</h3>
<p>By this time I thought I&#8217;d never have the blurb finished in time for the launch. But all these false starts were leading me to what I needed—as false starts do.</p>
<p>The mood had to be right. I needed to bring out another level underneath the events. I asked myself this: What was Carol’s real crisis? If she couldn&#8217;t play the piano, she didn&#8217;t belong in her life. Everywhere else she went, she felt like an outsider.</p>
<p>Now we were getting somewhere, and I used this <a title="Roz Morris's blog: It’s a cover! My Memories Of A Future Life – and how to find your novel’s theme" href="http://nailyournovel.wordpress.com/2011/07/23/its-a-cover-my-memories-of-a-future-life-and-how-to-find-your-novels-theme/" target="_blank">the first time I wrote anything to try to describe the book</a>. <em>How do you find where you belong?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a logline and it&#8217;s not bad, but I was sure I could do better.</p>
<p>Because there was one big, remaining problem. Good blurbs have to hint how the book will live up to its title.</p>
<p>So far, nothing I&#8217;d got lived up to the title’s witchy, metaphysical razzmatazz. If you take nothing else away from this post, take this. You snare the reader with the title, so the blurb must go with it.</p>
<p>So I scribbled something about my narrator, what her crisis was and how the title fit in with it all. Meanwhile I had the book out with early reviewers, who helped me fine-tune <a title="Back cover copy of Roz Morris's My Memories of a Future Life" href="http://mymemoriesofafuturelife.com/about-2/" target="_blank">the blurb here</a>.</p>
<h3>Tips for Writing Back Cover Copy for Non-Genre Books</h3>
<p>So here are my top tips for blurbing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push the right buttons—don&#8217;t lead the reader astray by a minor detail or a darling soundbite</li>
<li>Make sure your blurb communicates the mood of the book—is it gritty, wisecracking, gentle, melancholy?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget your title does some of the work—make sure blurb and title fit together</li>
</ul>
<div>Most of all, though, enjoy it. We&#8217;re all story lovers at heart. Blurb writing is still storytelling, gift-wrapping your book for new readers. Once you get the style in your head, it&#8217;s a lot of fun.</div>

<p>Thanks for the great post, Roz!  Read what she says here again: &#8220;[L]ook at what makes your book fit in with the genre—and how it stands out.&#8221;  I think that&#8217;s the key for genre books.</p>
<p>With non-genre or difficult books, we can&#8217;t use genre tropes as shorthand to set up reader expectations.  Instead, the words in our pitches, queries, and back cover copy must work harder to convey the mood and type of story it is and <a title="“What’s Your Book About?”" href="http://jamigold.com/2011/04/whats-your-book-about/" target="_blank">establish those expectations</a> from scratch.  And we have to make sure we&#8217;re establishing the <em>right</em> expectations, as Roz pointed out here, &#8220;When blurbing, it’s easy to think of a great soundbite and then become attached to it.&#8221;  In addition, our words must also give enough insight into the plot and emotional journey of the story to entice readers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tricky balance to be sure, and I haven&#8217;t found it with my stories yet.  *sigh*  But wish me luck because I&#8217;m trying to get a pitch ready this week.  Here&#8217;s hoping this post gives us all some new ideas about how to approach the challenge.</p>
<p>Do you have any questions for Roz?  Do you have any books that fall outside the typical expectations for a genre?  Do you struggle with boiling down the essence of your books?  Which piece is hardest for you—genre or story type, tone, or plot or journey details (or all of the above!)?  If you&#8217;ve tested your copy to see if it sets up the right expectations, how well did it match up?  Do you have any other tips to share?</p>

</p><p>Several people I know are going through revisions right now based on feedback they received from beta readers, agents, or editors.  Every one of them is dealing with the &#8220;I suck&#8221; issue along with that.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes feedback can be a bit too mean or blunt, but that&#8217;s not the problem here.  No matter how kind or helpful the comments are, we still feel like crap when faced with the fact that our writing needs work.</p>
<h3>How Do We Know When Our Work Is Ready to Share?</h3>
<p>Whether we&#8217;re perfectionists or not, we&#8217;re usually not going to send our writing into the world until we think it&#8217;s near perfect.  &#8221;Near perfect&#8221;?  How do we know where that line is?</p>
<p>We rely on our instincts to judge whether something is working or not, and we rely on our skills to fix what we find.  So we send something out when our <em>instincts</em> tell us it&#8217;s near perfect, and when our skills make it the best we can.</p>
<h3>What Feedback <em>Really</em> Tells Us</h3>
<p>And then what happens?  We get feedback pointing out how this part doesn&#8217;t flow and that character is unlikable.  We get comments about how we need to deepen the emotions in this scene and raise the stakes in that scene.</p>
<p>In short, feedback tells us our instincts were <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230;  Think about that for a minute.  (And let&#8217;s ignore grammatical flubs that come from a lack of knowledge.)  For deep analysis of the quality of our writing—the characters, plotting, and emotions—our instincts are the <em>one and only tool</em> we have for judging our own work.</p>
<p>When we get feedback that our one and only tool—that tool that told us we were ready to share our work because it was &#8220;near perfect&#8221;—was wrong, we&#8217;re going to react in an understandable way.  *cue panic, self-doubt, and &#8220;I suck&#8221;itude*</p>
<h3>The Self-Doubt Monster</h3>
<p>We wail, how can I ever know if my writing is any good if I can&#8217;t trust my instincts?  How can I trust myself to know how to fix these issues?  Sure, I <em>think</em> it&#8217;s better now, but I was wrong before.  What if I&#8217;m making it worse?  I might not even be able to tell because my instincts are Just. So. Worthless.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is the source of our self-doubt.  What can we trust if we can&#8217;t trust ourselves?  We might struggle to write, edit, or revise <em>anything</em> because we can&#8217;t trust that our changes are actually fixing things.  And how can we ever submit anything if our internal &#8220;near perfect&#8221; grade is delusional?</p>
<p>Every time we get feedback going beyond cut-and-dry skills like grammar usage, we <em>will</em> struggle with self-doubt.  We <em>will</em> feel like failures on some level.</p>
<p>Feedback comments like that hit us with &#8220;I was wrong&#8221; messages on two fronts at once, the writing itself and our judgment of the quality of that writing.  Again, think about that.  Deep feedback makes us doubt both our muse (the subconscious source of our writing) and our self-editor (the conscious judge of our work).  A double dose of doubt—just what we need.  Not.</p>
<h3>How to Beat the Monster</h3>
<p>For some of us, a major draw of traditional publishing is getting external validation, because we don&#8217;t trust our internal judgment <em>at all</em>.  I understand that reason, but I also find it sad.  Traditional publishing can be a great thing for some authors, but putting our sense of self-worth into the hands of others isn&#8217;t healthy.</p>
<p>Self-doubt can be debilitating and paralyzing.  Sometimes, we don&#8217;t want to move forward because we&#8217;re afraid we&#8217;ll make it worse and be too blind to realize it.  Or we&#8217;re afraid of wasting time with edits that don&#8217;t help.  Or we&#8217;re afraid to try again with a submission when our judgment is crap.  In short, we&#8217;re afraid of ourselves.</p>
<p>Writing <em>is</em> a risk.  We&#8217;re constantly taking the risk of wasting time, being rejected, and being told that we&#8217;re not as good as we think we are.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one <em>healthy</em> way through that self-doubt, and it doesn&#8217;t come from external validation.  We must <strong>accept the risk</strong> and <strong>ignore the fear</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe that means we say, &#8220;So what?&#8221;  So what if we waste time?  So what if we need to have another round of edits because this one didn&#8217;t fix it?  So what if we get a rejection?  None of those things are the end of the world unless we let them drive us to quit.</p>
<p>We have control over the self-doubt monster.  We choose whether we <em>allow</em> negativity to take over, our fears to hold us back, or the risks to paralyze us.</p>
<p>Yes, learning that we&#8217;re a terrible judge of our own work sucks, but it does get better.  We learn more about characterization, plotting and pacing techniques, and emotional triggers so we&#8217;ll have less of those issues in the future.  We learn about our weaknesses and work on them.</p>
<p>The gap between our judgment and the reality <em>does</em> narrow with experience.  But we&#8217;ll get there only if we beat back the monster and keep moving forward.</p>
<p>Do you feel self-doubt after receiving feedback?  If the comments are &#8220;kind,&#8221; do you still feel it?  How do you deal with self-doubt?  Do you have techniques for making your internal judgment more objective?  When is &#8220;pushing through the fear&#8221; harder?  Easier?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/what-does-writing-is-subjective-mean/" title="Permanent link to What Does &#8220;Writing Is Subjective&#8221; Mean?"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Male-model.jpg" width="289" height="300" alt="Male model with "bedroom" eyes" /></a>
</p><p>If you&#8217;ve sent out queries, you&#8217;ve probably received rejections.  They usually say things along the line of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;This is just my opinion and others may feel differently.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Just because I wasn&#8217;t drawn in doesn&#8217;t mean others won&#8217;t love it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Publishing is a subjective business and another agent would be better suited to your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t fault those who send those rejections like that.  Writing <em>is</em> subjective.</p>
<p>Heck, <em>most</em> things in life are subjective.  Some people like the outfits from the New York fashion shows, but others think they look like something an alien would wear.  Some people will think the guy in the picture of this post is hot, and others will think he looks like a douchebag.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re individuals.  We have different tastes, likes, dislikes, trigger points, etc.</p>
<h3>Characters? Real People? We&#8217;re All Unique</h3>
<p>As I pointed out before, <a title="What Makes a Character Unique?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/03/what-makes-a-character-unique/" target="_blank">one character wouldn&#8217;t react to plot events the same way as another character</a>.  (And we know real people aren&#8217;t <em>less</em> nuanced than characters!)  So it&#8217;s normal for people to react differently to the same input.</p>
<p>That truth was brought home to me (again) by the fantastic comments in my last post about <a title="What Stories *Won’t* You Write?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/what-stories-wont-you-write/" target="_blank">what stories we <em>won&#8217;t</em> write</a>.  The answers focused on many different aspects of writing: character traits, plot events, genres, profanity, sexual situations, and moral issues.</p>
<p>In other words, stories that some of us would love, others of us would hate.  Things that set some of us off are no big deal to others.</p>
<p>We each have to decide for ourselves what <em>we</em> want to write—what we want to have our name attached to.  We might make decisions based on our brand or our moral code, but only we can decide what&#8217;s best for us.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the comments of the last post, I don&#8217;t swear in real life, so I don&#8217;t use profanity in my stories unless necessary.  That means some of my stories have no swear words and some have quite a bit.  The same goes with sexual situations.  Some of my stories have just a kiss and some have very spicy scenes.  I listen to my muse and my characters to figure out what&#8217;s called for by each character and story.</p>
<p>Others will have different boundaries and make different decisions.  None of us is &#8220;wrong.&#8221;  Taste in <em>all</em> things is subjective.</p>
<h3>Having Different Opinions <em>Isn&#8217;t</em>  &#8220;Wrong&#8221;</h3>
<p>Differences of opinions come up all the time in book reviews.  The same book can receive multiple five star and one star reviews.  Even classics suffer from this fate, so it&#8217;s not just an issue of an author&#8217;s friends or enemies playing the system.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve probably experienced this ourselves.  People will tell us we <em>have</em> to read or watch a certain popular book/movie/TV show, and then we do&#8230;and we hate it.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re wrong or our friends are wrong.  We just like different things.</p>
<p>Similarly, the agents who reject us aren&#8217;t &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221; either.  Would we really want an agent who doesn&#8217;t <em>love</em> our work to represent us anyway?</p>
<h3>&#8220;Past Performance Is Not Indicative of Future Potential&#8221;</h3>
<p><a title="Sarah Callender's blog" href="http://sarahrcallender.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Sarah Callender</a> wrote about this issue on Writer Unboxed last week.  She revealed that when her original agent left the business right before she was supposed to go on submission to editors, <a title="Writer Unboxed: A Lesson from Kenny Rogers" href="http://writerunboxed.com/2012/04/13/a-lesson-from-kenny-rogers/" target="_blank">she elected to start the query process over</a> rather than end up with a random colleague from the same agency.</p>
<p>The agents she queried couldn&#8217;t even agree on whether her story was YA or adult, much less whether or not they liked it.  One loved the first half but not the second, while another one didn&#8217;t like the first half but thought the second half was great.  (And this was about a manuscript her former agent deemed ready to go on submission!)</p>
<p>This concept is something we have to remind ourselves of constantly.  Low scores on contests?  Rejections from agents?  Bad reviews?  Repeat after me: &#8220;Not everyone will love our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Low scores, rejections, and bad reviews aren&#8217;t indicative that <em>everyone</em> will feel the same way about our work.  We can get low scores and high scores from judges in the same contest.  We can get rejections in the same week we get offers.  We can get one-star reviews and five-star reviews on the same book.</p>
<p>This is why we have to listen to our muse before blindly implementing changes from critique partners or beta readers.  Only we can decide the kind of story we want to tell.  If a suggestion will help us tell <em>that</em> story better, we should make the change.  If a suggestion would take us further from that story, we shouldn&#8217;t implement it.  That difference of opinion doesn&#8217;t make either of us wrong.</p>
<p>Just like how what we <em>won&#8217;t</em> write is subjective, the same goes for reading and enjoying books.  And if we take a step back, we discover that <em>life</em>, how we view it and how we experience it, is all subjective as well.  *smile*</p>
<p>Can you think of other examples for how writing is subjective?  What about examples from outside of writing: fashion, movies, etc.  (Do we dare mention how religious and political beliefs are subjective?)  Have you received wide ranges of opinions about your work?</p>

</p><p>In my last post, we talked about <a title="Do Your Stories Match Your Voice?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/do-your-stories-match-your-voice/" target="_blank">voice and how we tend to write the same types of characters, premises, and themes</a> over and over.  That&#8217;s not a bad thing.  Those stories resonate with us as writers.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are stories we would <em>never</em> write.  Stories might be so against our internal grain that if an idea along those lines occurred to us, we&#8217;d immediately try to turn the concept around.  Or the idea would be like a road to nowhere, and we&#8217;d dismiss the idea out of hand.</p>
<p>For example, if we&#8217;re drawn to strong heroines, we probably wouldn&#8217;t write a doormat type.  If we enjoy rooting for the underdogs in stories, it&#8217;s doubtful an idea to make a bully into a hero would appeal to us.  Or if we write about the power of love, our muse is unlikely to nag us to start a story where everyone dies miserable and alone.</p>
<p>Just as we can learn about ourselves as writers by studying what stories we tend to write, we can learn about ourselves by figuring out what we <em>won&#8217;t</em> write.  Those limits might echo the stories we don&#8217;t enjoy reading, or plot points that squick us out, or situations against our moral code, and sometimes, a premise simply doesn&#8217;t appeal to us as a writer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read countless stories with love triangles, but I&#8217;m unlikely to ever write a story with a straightforward triangle of two heroes and one heroine.  In YA, where the young heroine often <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> make long-term commitments, triangles can work.  However, in adult stories, the heroine comes off in too many love triangles as flighty or unable to make up her mind.</p>
<p>Even worse for me are the triangles where a heroine faces off with another woman for the hero&#8217;s affection.  I can’t stand <em>reading</em> stories where there’s a feeling of competition between the heroine and any other woman.  Can. Not. Stand. Them.  So <em>writing</em> them?  No, the chances of me writing a story along those lines are nil and none.</p>
<p>By analyzing my &#8220;won&#8217;t write&#8221; boundaries, I learned I have no interest in writing jealousy.  Part of the reason for that has to do with my genre.  I write paranormal romances and paranormal stories with romantic elements.  The hero and heroine are supposed to be perfect for each other, and that doesn&#8217;t leave much room for a third party.   Jealousy is angsty, not sexy or romantic.</p>
<p>The other part of the reason has to do with my personal reaction to jealousy.  I <em>hate</em> experiencing such an ugly emotion.  (Yes, I realize the irony of describing my reaction to one negative emotion by embracing &#8220;hatred,&#8221; another negative emotion.)  So I avoid jealousy at all costs in my life.  The last thing I want to do is explore that emotion for a story.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the things we <em>won&#8217;t</em> write can become as much a part of our brand as the things we <em>do</em> write (think about inspirational romance authors).  Readers grow to trust us for our boundaries.  That means if they see an &#8220;iffy&#8221; element in a back cover description, they might trust that we&#8217;ll handle it with intelligence and sensitivity, because they know we wouldn&#8217;t write about it any other way.</p>
<p>This goes back to my post about not <a title="Exploiting Our Brand: Is There a “Right” Way?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/03/exploiting-our-brand-is-there-a-right-way/" target="_blank">exploiting our brand</a> in a bad way.  We should recognize what makes up our brand, both in what we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> and in what we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don&#8217;t do</span>.  If we don&#8217;t want to lose readers, we have to honor our brand.  We <em>can</em> change the limits of our writing (look at Anne Rice&#8217;s many reinventions), but there are risks.</p>
<p>One thing I try to point out with all my posts about branding is to be <em>aware</em> of the impression we create.  If we&#8217;re aware of the messages we&#8217;re sending, we can ensure they match what we want others to think about those intangible confines of our work.  And if others want to limit us too much, that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t branch out, but maybe it means we have to tweak our message to broaden others&#8217; impression of us.</p>
<p>Are there stories you <em>won&#8217;t</em> write?  Why won&#8217;t you write them?  Do you avoid reading stories along those lines as well?  Can you think of any authors where you know their boundaries?  Have you ever lost trust in an author because they broke the limits you thought they had?</p>

</p><p>I&#8217;ve been having a great conversation with <a title="Serena Yung on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/severineyung" target="_blank">Serena Yung</a> in the comments of <a title="Need Voice? Think Out Loud" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/02/need-voice-think-out-loud/" target="_blank">one of my posts about voice</a> from a few weeks ago, so voice has been on my mind again this week.  When I found <a title="Julie Leto: Ditching “The Book of Your Heart” for “The Book of My Voice”" href="http://www.julieleto.com/articles/ditching-the-book-of-your-heart-for-the-book-of-my-voice/" target="_blank">a fantastic article by author Julie Leto about voice and how it relates to our writing</a>, I knew I had to blog about it.</p>
<p>Julie shares a quote by Laura Backes of the Children&#8217;s Book Insider that I love:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The voice is what beckons the reader to curl up with a book and whispers, &#8216;Pay attention.  I’m going to tell you a story.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you a story.&#8221;</em>  That concept goes along with <a title="Janice Hardy: Can You Hear Me Now? Developing Your Voice" href="http://blog.janicehardy.com/2011/01/can-you-hear-me-now-developing-your.html" target="_blank">my other favorite voice concept by Janice Hardy</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;[V]oice is that sense there’s a person behind the words.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m</em> going to tell you a story. There&#8217;s a <em>person</em> behind the words.  Voice is intimacy.  Voice is what invites readers to join the characters in their journey.</p>
<h3>What Goes into Our Voice?</h3>
<p>How do we invite readers to come closer?  Many people have tried to identify what goes into creating our voice, but it&#8217;s a hard thing to define.  We often just know it when we see it.</p>
<p>In her article, Julie shares what she sees as the five most important elements of voice:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How much do we use?  How many senses do we evoke?  What tone do we take when we write?  The importance of description to us as authors and how we use it comes down to the types of stories we innately want to tell.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Character</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What types of characters do we gravitate toward while we&#8217;re writing?  Some of us write stronger alpha males than others, some write snarkier women.  The common threads between our characters—from one heroine to another or one hero to another—give insight into our voice.  This doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t create characters who <em>aren&#8217;t</em> a good match for our voice, but they might be harder to write.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Style</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What are our writing habits?  Do we end scenes or chapters on cliffhangers?  Do we write with a lyrical quality or are our sentence more choppy?  The words we use and how we break up sentences, paragraphs, and chapters all act as one ingredient of our voice.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Plot</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do we write beat-driven plots where readers sense when big events occur?  Or do we write plots where one event blends into the next?  What kind of villains or secondary characters do we write, and what kind of conflict do they create?</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Premise and Theme</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What&#8217;s the big picture and/or theme of our stories?  Writers typically revisit similar themes over and over.  At the high level, we might also write stories with similar premises.  Heroines who discover how special they are.  Heroes who must fight to get what they want.</p>
<p>Did you notice what all those things have in common?  We find the commonalities we tend to gravitate toward <em>after</em> the fact—after we have multiple stories to compare.</p>
<h3>Gaining a Voice Takes Lots of Practice</h3>
<p>In other words, we have to practice writing <em>a lot</em> before we become good at recognizing what makes our writing ours alone and what makes our voice unique.  I didn&#8217;t recognize my voice until I started my third story.  Julie said it took her the same number of manuscripts.</p>
<p>She also points out that we can&#8217;t explore any of those elements with our voice until we have the craft down.  If we&#8217;re still struggling with plot structure, our unique approach to plotting won&#8217;t be as clear.  If we&#8217;re still head-hopping, the point-of-view of our characters won&#8217;t be deep enough to show who they really are.  Same with the other elements.</p>
<h3>We Have a Voice, Now What?</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;ve written enough that we have a clear idea of what makes our voice unique, what do we <em>do</em> with that knowledge?</p>
<p>When we know the idiosyncrasies of our voice, we know what types of stories are a good match for us.  Maybe we&#8217;re writing YA stories but our voice would work well in adult fiction.  Maybe comedy would be a better match than suspense.  Or maybe our plotting approach would fit novellas more than novels.</p>
<p>In other words, once we know our strengths, we can play to them.  Julie calls this writing &#8220;a book of our voice&#8221; rather than chasing &#8220;the book of our heart.&#8221;  We can discover the types of stories we truly <em>love</em> to write.  And in many cases, those stories will be easier to write than if we fight our natural tendencies.</p>
<p>This knowledge might help us decide between multiple shiny projects.  Does one story idea fit our voice better than the other?  If so, that doesn&#8217;t mean we <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> write the other one, but we&#8217;ll be aware upfront that we might find it more difficult.</p>
<p>Also, the more we <em>know</em> our voice, the more we&#8217;ll be able to resist misguided suggestions from others.  One of my beta readers struggled with her editor because she tends to write dark stories and her editor wanted her to make a story fluffier and happier.  She&#8217;d have been miserable if she tried to fit that box.  Knowing the stories that fit <em>her</em> helps her know when to say &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Know Thyself and Others Will Too</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard how we should write multiple stories rather than editing the same one over and over.  That advice isn&#8217;t just about making sure we&#8217;re moving forward.</p>
<p>Writing new stories with new characters and new plots and new premises all works together to help us find the commonalities in our writing.  Those commonalities inform our voice, the stories we like to write, and the stories that might be easier to write.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, being aware of those commonalities can also help us create our brand.  Readers would know that we&#8217;ll give them a story with X kind of characters, Y kind of style, or Z kind of plot.  (&#8220;Ooo, she writes the best tortured heroes.&#8221;)  And readers who know what to expect from our writing—even if we switch genres—might become fans of <em>us</em> rather than just readers of our books.</p>
<p>How well do you know your voice?  Can you describe it in regards to those five elements?  If you&#8217;ve written multiple stories, how many did it take for you to have a clear idea of your voice?  What do you think of the &#8220;book of our voice&#8221; idea?  Did you gain any other insights from <a title="Julie Leto: Ditching “The Book of Your Heart” for “The Book of My Voice”" href="http://www.julieleto.com/articles/ditching-the-book-of-your-heart-for-the-book-of-my-voice/" target="_blank">Julie&#8217;s article</a>?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/are-you-missing-blog-readers/" title="Permanent link to Are You Missing Blog Readers?"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Empty-shoes.jpg" width="227" height="300" alt="Where are you? Empty shoes on an empty beach" /></a>
</p><p>Now that the dust has settled from <a title="Goodbye, Google Friend Connect–Now What?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/02/goodbye-google-friend-connect-now-what/" target="_blank">the disappearance of Google Friend Connect</a> (GFC) from all non-Blogger blogs, I thought I&#8217;d post a followup examining how much the discontinuation affected people.</p>
<p>Those of us who never had the GFC widget on our blogs weren&#8217;t affected at all.  Same goes for those who have Blogger blogs and still have GFC (for the moment).</p>
<p>But many bloggers <em>had</em> used the GFC widget.  At the very least, we might have fewer readers now.  Or our newsletter subscribers might be gone.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a title="Goodbye, Google Friend Connect–Now What?" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/02/goodbye-google-friend-connect-now-what/" target="_blank">my earlier post</a>, I fell at the low end of GFC integration.  I had the GFC widget on my blog, but I never promoted it for more followers.  Regardless of that fact, the loss of GFC affected me.  Did it affect you the same way?  Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<h3>No Google Friend Connect = Fewer Feed Readers?</h3>
<p>I use Feedburner for my RSS feed, and I&#8217;d assumed Feedburner reflected only those readers who had subscribed to my blog via RSS.  Wrong.  Both GFC and Feedburner are Google products, so of course they&#8217;d been integrated beyond what I knew.</p>
<p>What this means is that people who had signed in to my GFC widget also counted toward my Feedburner subscriber total.  Most of those users didn&#8217;t see the blogs they signed into via GFC in their Google Reader, but the GFC/Blogger Dashboard has a mini-feedreader built in.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know my Feedburner numbers also included GFC followers and wasn&#8217;t just RSS subscribers.  Silly me.  While two-thirds of my GFC followers had also subscribed to my RSS feed, about one-third had not.  How do I know?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the graphic for my all-time Feedburner stats:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4559" title="Feedburner stats" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Feedburner-stats.jpg" alt="" width="463" height="144" /></p>
<p>The green line shows my subscriber number increasing—until the blue arrow points out March 1st, the date GFC disappeared for all non-Blogger blogs.  That dip represents the number of people who had followed me via GFC but not RSS subscription.</p>
<p>Luckily, I don&#8217;t care about numbers, or else the sudden disappearance of a bunch of &#8220;readers&#8221; would have depressed me.  *smile*  I know the reality is many people joined sites via GFC and then never visited again.</p>
<p>My only concern about the missing one-third of GFC followers is that some of them <em>were</em> reading my blog in their Blogger Dashboard.  All of a sudden, my blog disappeared from their &#8220;Blogs I&#8217;m Following&#8221; list (from what I can tell), and I don&#8217;t expect any of them were devoted enough to my blog to notice it isn&#8217;t there anymore.  (Heck, I wouldn&#8217;t notice if Twitter accidentally unfollowed one of my BFFs.)  We don&#8217;t notice things that are missing.  We just don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Those who wanted to follow my blog might eventually find their way back through a Twitter link or something.  And maybe they&#8217;ll realize they haven&#8217;t seen my recent posts in their Dashboard.  And maybe they&#8217;ll figure it out and subscribe to my RSS feed.  Or maybe they won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Life is too short to worry about such things, but from a curiosity perspective, I wondered if I was the only one who saw this dip in feed readers.  So let&#8217;s compare notes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you had followed me via GFC, do you still see my blog in your Blogger Dashboard list, or has it disappeared?</li>
<li>If you had GFC on your blog (and no longer do), have you noticed an ongoing traffic decrease as of March 1st?</li>
<li>If you had GFC <em>and</em> Feedburner, do your all-time stats show a dip like in my graphic above?</li>
<li>Have you noticed any other effects from the GFC disappearance?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can&#8217;t do anything to fix the situation, but maybe by comparing notes, we can help each other feel better about those &#8220;missing&#8221; readers.  *smile*</p>

</p><p>My post about <a title="MS Word Trick: Combining Changes and Comments" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/ms-word-trick-combining-changes-and-comments/" target="_blank">combining comments from multiple beta readers in MS Word</a> brought up a great question.  How do we <em>get</em> beta readers?</p>
<p>In the comments, <a title="Amanda K. Byrne's blog" href="http://amandakbyrne.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Amanda Byrne</a> asked, “[A]ny hints on how you can scare up more beta readers? … [O]nly one of them gets back to me in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>Then <a title="Aldrea Alien's blog" href="http://thardrandia.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Aldrea Alien</a> pointed out, “I don’t wanna give someone my work and find I&#8217;ve not the time, or the skill, to properly reciprocate.”</p>
<p>These comments bring up multiple issues, and I’ll do my best to address each one.</p>
<h3>What Does a Beta Reader Do?</h3>
<p>The first thing to recognize is that just about <em>anyone</em> can be a beta reader.  Our mom. Our neighbor. A random Twitter follower.  Unlike a critique partner, who might comment on grammar and whatnot, a beta reader gives high-level feedback.</p>
<p>Can our mom be honest and point out confusing sentences or plot events?  Where her attention wavers?  Whether she finds the characters likable or sympathetic?  If so, she’d make a fine beta reader.</p>
<p>Next question is to ask ourselves if <em>we</em> can answer yes to those same questions.  If so, we’re qualified to be a beta reader as well.</p>
<p>For example, the last time I sent out a manuscript for beta reading, this is what I asked people to mark:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything that takes you out of the story (confusing wording, voice/characterization seems off, too repetitive, no conflict/tension, etc.).</li>
<li>Pacing issues (too slow, feels too &#8220;one note,&#8221; not enough of an arc, scene goes on too long, etc.).</li>
<li>Emotional feedback (I&#8217;d love to see stream-of-consciousness emotional reactions when you notice them/think of adding them).</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it.  Beta reading is <em>not</em> about the reader’s knowledge of the craft of writing, but about what works and doesn&#8217;t work for them as a reader.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t discount our ability to provide useful feedback because we’re not perfect writers ourselves yet.  I can’t write a query letter to save my life, but I can still point out if someone’s query letter mentions too many characters by name, has a confusing-sounding plot, or reads flat.</p>
<h3>Here, Beta Reader, Come Out Wherever You Are</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve addressed why we shouldn&#8217;t think we’re “not skilled enough” to beta read for someone else, my advice to Amanda in the comments of the last post might make more sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I think the key is to be a good beta reader yourself and then offer to help others with their work.  If they find your comments helpful, you can usually work out a beta buddy exchange arrangement.”</p>
<p>It’s that simple and that hard.  We offer our services to others.  I’m always looking for readers with fresh eyes to check a reworked project.  Probably many other writers are the same way.  We welcome offers of beta reading.</p>
<p>This advice assumes we’re targeting other writers as beta readers, but  I didn’t start off that way.  My first readers were family members.  I then “graduated” to one critique partner I met through the comments of an editing blog we both visited, and we gave each other line-by-line feedback.  After I was experienced enough to take high-level comments and figure out what I needed to do to fix the issue, I switched over to using beta readers.</p>
<p>I met one at a conference, I offered to read for another because I love her blog and her writing, I answered a call for readers on Twitter for another, etc.  If we’re being social on blogs or other social media, we’ll meet people we “click” with.  Offer to read for them.</p>
<h3>Are We Ready to Give as Well as We Get?</h3>
<p>Why do I use mostly writers even though I pointed out above that non-writers can provide helpful feedback too?  Professionalism.</p>
<p>Most non-writers don’t understand our deadlines, whether those are self-driven, contest deadlines, or an agent request.  Non-writers are more likely to blow off the seriousness of our statement, “I’d like to have all feedback returned to me by such-and-such date.”</p>
<p>Even other writers might not take our deadlines seriously.  Some of us are more professionally oriented than others.  That’s not a bad thing.</p>
<p>The trick is finding people who match our level.  The second trick is making sure we hold up our end of the bargain.  We can’t expect professionalism from a beta buddy if we’re not willing to do the same.</p>
<p>Yes, that means sometimes we have to make <em>their</em> writing a priority over ours.  If we promised them feedback by a certain date—and we want them to keep their promises to us—we have to be willing to put our work on the back burner and read theirs instead.  If we want to get deep, helpful comments from them, we have to spend the time to give them the same.</p>
<h3>Are They a Good Match?</h3>
<p>Some writers might not know what it means to be a good beta reader, but will learn if they have it modeled for them.  We should give others the style of feedback we’d like to receive.</p>
<p>To avoid burning a bunch of time on someone who might not be a good match, we can offer to give feedback on a query letter, synopsis, a short story, or the first chapter of their novel.  See how they react to our feedback.  Are they defensive, or do they blow it off?  If so, we’ll keep looking for a better match.</p>
<p>If they seem appreciative and seem to “get” our feedback, we can ask them to check something small for us.  Are their comments helpful and insightful?  Are we able to take their style of comments (the harsh and honest factor)?</p>
<p>Yes, there is a give and take aspect to being beta buddies with others.  We can’t ask others to spend time giving us feedback if we’re not willing to do the same.  But I usually learn something new when I’m helping others, so I find that I win both when reading for someone else <em>and</em> when getting comments from readers.</p>
<p>Have you offered to beta read for others?  Do you think you&#8217;re a good beta reader, or could you use more pointers?  What drives you crazy when others read for you (they never get back to you, etc.)?  Have you used writers or non-writers so far?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a class="post_image_link" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/ms-word-trick-combining-changes-and-comments/" title="Permanent link to MS Word Trick: Combining Changes and Comments"><img class="post_image alignleft frame" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Flower-with-bees.jpg" width="300" height="224" alt="Sunflower with honeybees" /></a>
</p><p>We all have weaknesses.  Some people want to deny their imperfections, but most of us do what we can to overcome them.</p>
<p>Like many writers, one of my weaknesses is my inability to interpret my words the way a reader does.  That’s not unusual.  We <em>know</em> what we meant to say, so it’s easy to overlook how our word choice or sentence structure might lead to misperceptions or confusion in others.</p>
<p>I try to overcome that issue by using multiple beta readers.  Each of my beta readers finds different things in my work, so their group effort gives me more information than I get from looking at their feedback separately.  Just as a group of bees can turn nectar into honey, my beta readers&#8217; notes together provide deep insights into the story and characters beyond their surface comments.  (Yes, I love my beta readers, can you tell?  *smile*)</p>
<h3>Overwhelmed by Comments from Beta Readers?</h3>
<p>On my latest work-in-progress (WIP), they gave me a total of about 1000 comments.  Believe it or not, that didn’t send me off crying in the corner, because I genuinely love getting feedback that will make my work better.  However, having multiple beta readers means I have to juggle several MS Word documents to see all their comments at once.</p>
<p>My solution?  The MS Word “Combine” function.  <a title="Cheryl Reif: 10 Ways to Use Microsoft Word More Effectively" href="http://www.cherylreif.com/2012/03/27/10-ways-to-use-microsoft-word-more-effectively/" target="_blank">Cheryl Reif’s recent post about MS Word tips and tricks</a> reminded me that I hadn’t shared this technique on my blog yet.</p>
<h3>Where to Find the Combine Function in MS Word</h3>
<p>All my beta readers use “Track Changes” and “Comments” within MS Word.  These settings can be found under the “Review” menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-4477" title="MS Word Review tab" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Review-tab.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="115" /></p>
<p>Some of you might be familiar with the “Compare” function within MS Word, which is also under the Review menu.  This function is an easy way to compare one version of a document with another.  See tip number seven on <a title="Cheryl Reif: 10 Ways to Use Microsoft Word More Effectively" href="http://www.cherylreif.com/2012/03/27/10-ways-to-use-microsoft-word-more-effectively/" target="_blank">Cheryl&#8217;s post for more about Compare</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Compare-function.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-4476 aligncenter" title="MS Word Compare function" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Compare-function-500x73.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="66" /></a></p>
<p>The Combine function is related to the Compare function.  In fact, Combine is found under Compare in the Review menu.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-4474 aligncenter" title="MS Word Combine function" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-function.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="192" /></p>
<h3>How the Combine Function Helps Us Dig Deeper</h3>
<p>So what can we do with the Combine function?  We can collate all the comments and changes from our beta readers into one document.</p>
<p>Now, instead of clicking between multiple feedback documents, I have just one document where I can see every tracked change, every highlight, and every comment from all my beta readers.  In addition, I can easily see if one section gets comments from multiple readers.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-results.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-4475 aligncenter" title="MS Word Combine results" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-results-500x49.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="44" /></a></p>
<p>If two or more readers come back with a note about how they’re confused by a sentence or paragraph, we <em>know</em> we have a problem.  If two or more readers make comments about the pacing of a section, we <em>know</em> we have work to do.  This organization makes it easier to judge what changes should be made.</p>
<h3>How to Use the Combine Function</h3>
<p>The trickiest part is that combining all these documents requires several steps.  The Combine function lets us combine two documents at once, so we have to go through the process multiple times, once for each beta reader to integrate their changes into a master copy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.  From the Review menu, go into Compare, and then select Combine.  This will bring up the Combine dialog box.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.  Under Original Document, select Browse, and find the original document you sent to your beta readers.  (The emails you sent to your beta readers would have this version if you didn’t keep it.)</p>
<p><a href="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-dialog-box-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-4471 aligncenter" title="MS Word Combine dialog box 1" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-dialog-box-1-500x141.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="127" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.  Under Revised Document, select Browse, and find the first beta feedback document.</p>
<p><a href="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-dialog-box-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-4472 aligncenter" title="MS Word Combine dialog box 2" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-dialog-box-2-500x139.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="125" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4.  If you want MS Word to pick up highlighting in addition to tracked changes and comments, make sure Formatting is checked (under the More&gt;&gt; button).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5.  Under Show Changes, select New Document to specify <em>how</em> to combine them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6.  Then click “OK.”</p>
<p><a href="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-dialog-box-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-4473 aligncenter" title="MS Word Combine dialog box 3" src="http://jamigold.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MS-Word-Combine-dialog-box-3-500x338.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7.  MS Word will create a new document showing all the changes.  Use “Save As” to save this new document as something like &#8220;Combined Beta Notes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">8.  Select Combine again, this time use &#8220;Combined Beta Notes&#8221; as your Original Document (i.e., the document you just made that has the changes from the first beta reader).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">9.  Pick the next beta reader’s document for the Revised Document selection.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10.  Make sure Formatting is still checked, and this time, under Show Changes, select Original Document.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">11.  Click “OK.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">12.  Save it under the same name.  Now this document is the original <em>plus</em> the changes from the first two beta readers.</p>
<p>Repeat steps 8 through 12 as needed to combine the notes from all beta readers, saving it under the same name each time.  Once all beta reader changes and comments have been saved to the &#8220;Combined Beta Notes&#8221; document, we can easily get through all the necessary editing in one pass.  I usually &#8220;Reject&#8221; each comment or change after I make the edits in my master WIP document so I can see what issues I have left to address.</p>
<h3>Multiple Beta Readers Allow Us to See Deeper</h3>
<p>Because of this technique, I can see where my beta readers agree, pointing out where I definitely need to address an issue.  In the example I inserted above, two of my readers thought the heroine&#8217;s emotions swung too quickly in a scene.  Since I knew what my heroine was thinking, I might have ignored the comment if just one of my beta readers had said something.  However, the presence of two comments tells me not to ignore it.</p>
<p>After digging deeper, I found a few words a couple of paragraphs earlier that probably led my readers to think she was more pissed than she really was.  Oops.  *blush*  I never would have realized the perception I&#8217;d accidentally created without this method for combining my readers&#8217; comments.</p>
<p>Other times, we might get comments with opposite feedback.  In that case, we have to figure out whether it&#8217;s a confusion issue (and we have to make our meaning clearer), a perception issue (and we have to tweak our word choice), or something else.  Sometimes our beta readers want a story to go one way and we&#8217;ve made it go a different way.  When that happens, maybe we need to &#8220;sell&#8221; our version of the story better to get readers to buy into it more fully.</p>
<p>No matter how we use beta readers, if we have multiple readers with multiple feedback documents, we&#8217;ll have a clearer picture of their perceptions if we can see all their comments at once.  The Combine function makes this easy.</p>
<p>Do you use multiple beta readers?  What benefits do you see in having multiple beta readers?  What negatives do you see?  Have you ever used the Combine function before?  Will this help you organize your editing?  Do you have any other tips to share?</p>
<p>P.S.  In case you missed it, I posted an April Fool&#8217;s Day surprise on Sunday.  My Tech Guy made a special appearance as <a title="Smeagol Presents: The Hunger Games" href="http://jamigold.com/2012/04/smeagol-presents-the-hunger-games/" target="_blank">Sméagol from <em>Lord of the Rings</em> reading <em>The Hunger Games</em></a>.  Enjoy!</p>
